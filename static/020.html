       There’s one fruit that can help feed hungry people who live in warm and wet areas in the world. It’s called a breadfruit, but it doesn’t look like bread. It’s a round green fruit with an unsmooth skin on the outside. When it’s ready to eat, the skin looks a little yellow and brown. It doesn’t have much taste, and most people say it’s a lot like a potato.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The breadfruit is a good source of food because one tree can produce around 250 fruits each year. The tree is also easy to take care of. But the biggest reason why breadfruit may be the answer to feeding poor people is the healthy ingredients that this fruit provides.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It may be a fruit, but it has a lot of healthy ingredients like meat, which is important especially in poor countries where people can’t afford meat. The biggest problem may be for the people to accept this fruit as part of their cultural diet.

      <div style="text-align: justify;">
       When an airplane was on fire and landed at the airport safely, many passengers on the plane were not in a hurry to exit the plane. These people were warned to leave their belongings and just get out. Instead, many of them reached up into the overhead cases and got their bags before they left the plane.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We might react in the same way, but experts say it’s the wrong thing to do. We waste too much time getting our things, and whilst we’re trying to get out of the plane, the bags can block the way to the exit, or people can fall over the bags and injure themselves.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Some experts think airlines should lock these cases, but many people think this would be very unpopular because passengers want to be able to get things out of their bags during the flight.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Everyone agrees that in a life or death situation, our material things are not important.

      <div style="text-align:justify">
       M: I’m trying to quit smoking, but it’s so difficult!
       <br/>
       W: That’s because your brain makes you desire the chemicals in the cigarettes.
       <br/>
       M: How does it do that?
       <br/>
       W: There’s a part of your brain that makes you want more of something. When that becomes excessive, it’s called addiction. If you have an addiction, your brain is telling you to find more of what it wants. For example, you can have an addiction to cigarettes or food, and this means you constantly want to smoke or eat because of your brain.
       <br/>
       M: I thought it was because I wasn’t strong enough to fight my desire.
       <br/>
       W: That’s what people used to think. They thought people were weak and couldn’t stop themselves because they had no self-control. But doctors now understand that some brains have a system that creates addiction.
       <br/>
       M: How does it work?
       <br/>
       W: The brain releases a chemical when it feels pleasure. So when you eat a delicious cake, your brain sends out a chemical as a reward. Each time you experience this pleasure, your brain releases more of the chemical.
       <br/>
       M: What does the chemical do?
       <br/>
       W: It takes over the brain, so the other brain chemicals that would tell us to stop eating cakes aren’t effective anymore.
       <br/>
       M: So it’s not about self-control or being weak?
       <br/>
       W: Not really. It’s difficult to control when the brain is sending chemical signals that make your body feel pleasure. The problem is that when we experience this pleasure too much, we get used to it. So if you eat one cake at first, soon you’ll need two cakes to feel the same pleasure.
       <br/>
       M: Is that why people become overweight?
       <br/>
       W: Yes. The problem of smoking, overeating or even taking drugs comes from the same brain chemical.
       <br/>
       M: How can we stop our addiction?
       <br/>
       W: Experts say to find other things that give you pleasure like a hobby or interest in healthy activities.

       When we think about famous athletes in the US, we don’t think about university-educated, intelligent people. Most professional athletes have no reason to go to college since they can make millions of dollars each year playing on a professional team. However, once in a while, there is an athlete that doesn’t fit our perceptions. One athlete is professional basketball player, Jeremy Lin.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jeremy was born in California and was captain of his high school basketball team. He was accepted to many universities but chose to attend Harvard because they offered him a position on their basketball team. During his years at Harvard, Jeremy broke many basketball records. After four years, Jeremy graduated from Harvard University in 2010 with a degree in economics.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       However, he didn’t want a job in this field; instead, he chose to play professional basketball. He played for a New York team in 2012 but didn’t play very much at first. After he had the opportunity to play in more games, Jeremy became very popular and famous in just a few short weeks. During those few weeks, Jeremy played outstanding basketball. In one game, he scored more points than superstar Kobe Bryant.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       His picture was on the cover of many newspapers and magazines. Television news also spent a lot of time showing his amazing abilities. Jeremy also became more valuable. After his success, he was given a four-year contract worth almost 30 million dollars. Since he earned a lot of money as a professional basketball player, it’s unclear if he’ll ever use his Harvard degree. However, his time at Harvard helped him form the leadership skills he needed to be successful in basketball. His degree will also give him the ability to have a successful career when he is unable to play basketball anymore.

       <p>
        Why did Jeremy choose to attend Harvard?

        When did he score more points than superstar Kobe Bryant?

       The fountain of youth isn’t so far off. Scientists have discovered a revolutionary molecule that could be crucial to the health and survival of Mars astronauts—and crucial to helping us look young forever.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Our cells have the ability to repair themselves, but that declines with age—and scientists finally discovered why. The breakthrough comes after six years of DNA research from scientists. Researchers found that it’s one of the human body’s most abundant proteins that hinders the healing process of the human body. The aging related protein is called DBC1. Then the team found a molecule called NAD, which stops that protein from getting in the way of cell repair. The older we get, the less NAD molecules we have.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       In trials, researchers had mice drink water that contains NAD. The cells of the old mice were no different from the young mice after just one week of treatment. Not to mention the treated mice showed improved kidney function, regrown fur and the ability to run twice as fast as their untreated mouse friends.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       NASA has already expressed interest in the miracle drug for their Mars astronauts, since radiation on the red planet almost guarantees they’ll develop cancer. It could also be used to help childhood cancer survivors, 96 percent of whom develop a sign of accelerated aging by 45. “This is the closest we are to a safe and effective anti-aging drug that’s perhaps only three to five years away from being on the market if trials go well,” Sinclair said. Human trials of the treatment are set to begin within six months.

        Women in the Labor Force
       </b>
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       A) Women are considered labor force participants only if they work outside the home. In the past women were expected to be in the labor force only until they married; this reflected the historical, idealized notion of a society in which the man was the breadwinner and the woman the homemaker. This notion of the family was not a reality in the past and is not so today, since more than half of all married women work outside the home. But the idea that women belong in the home has had a significant effect on the conditions under which they participate in the labor force. That participation is characterized by segregation and low pay.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       B) The majority of women in the labor force have always been isolated in “female” occupations, called such because they are often extensions of the work women do at home and because the vast majority of the people doing them are women. Some occupations have changed over time and new ones have come into existence, but various occupations are still defined as women’s work. Today women have one unpaid job in the home and one low-paid job in the labor force. Women have always been responsible for work in the home and in the labor force they have always been paid lower wages than men. They have been paid less both when their jobs are not the same as those of men but could be seen as equally valuable and when the work is exactly the same. Women earned 52.8 percent of what men earned in 1911, 58 percent in 1971 and 66 percent in 1996.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       C) At the end of the 19th century, factories replaced families as main productive units. Factory work involved long hours, low wages and often brutal working conditions. For example, young girls worked for 60 hours a week for 80 cents, or less than two cents per hour. In 1901 women comprised 13 percent of the total labor force and the female labor-force participation rate was 14 percent (this refers to women who worked for pay; many women worked but were not paid).
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       D) The majority of women were employed as servants, dressmakers, teachers, seamstresses (女裁缝师), tailors, housekeepers, launderers, milliners (女帽商) and saleswomen. During the first half of the 20th century, the number of jobs available to women was limited and strong sentiment existed against married women working outside the home. Men feared that the cheap labor of large numbers of women would undercut their wages; employers and moral reformers were concerned that work would impair the femininity and high moral standards of women and distract them from their true calling as wives and mothers.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       E) During World War I, women replaced men who had joined the armed services, but the labor shortage was not severe enough to warrant their large-scale employment. Although women did men’s jobs, they did not receive men’s wages. By 1921, 65 percent of all women workers were in clerical, domestic service and professional (mainly teaching and nursing) occupations.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       F) In the early part of the 20th century, women’s fight for equality focused on political rights and was characterized by the suffrage (选举权) movement. The right to the federal vote was finally won in 1918, and by 1922 women had won the right to vote in all provinces except Quebec, where the struggle continued until 1940. In 1929 women were recognized as “persons” eligible to hold a seat in the Canadian Senate.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       G) The expansionary period of the 1920s was cut short by the Great Depression, but production and employment expanded enormously with World War II and once again employers hired single and then married women to do men’s jobs, once again for lower wages. This time, however, many stayed and found employment in the service industries.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       H) Greater numbers of women entering the labor force presented male-dominated trade unions with a dilemma. Trade unionists feared the competition from “unskilled” female labor and were concerned as well with maintaining the traditional role of women. Simultaneously, they were interested in protecting all workers, including women. Women workers, however, with or without the support of the trade-union movement, have traditionally fought for higher wages and better working conditions.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       I) The 1950s was a time of rapid economic expansion. Changes in the productive process, emphasis by government and private industry on construction and on research and development, expansion in health, welfare and educational services, and the need to advertise, sell and finance new products all created new jobs for women.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       J) By mid-20th century many families, in order to be able to afford more goods and to educate their children, needed two income earners. Because young people were staying in school longer, married women entered the labor force to help their families raise their standard of living.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       K) Since the 1950s there has been a steady increase in part-time work and by 1994 the number of part-time jobs, which have few benefits and little security, had expanded enormously; 69.4 percent of these were filled by women. Women continued to earn lower wages than men and in 1980 the average wage rate for full-time women workers was 64 percent of that of the average wage rate for men workers. By 1993 women’s wages had increased somewhat and men’s wages had declined, narrowing the gap between their earnings to 72 percent. In 1994, 70 percent of women were still employed in clerical, sales, service, teaching and nursing and health-related occupations; women comprised 43 percent of the total labor force.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       L) From 1971 women organized to demand greater equality in wages and working conditions, and to gain recognition of their social, economic, legal and political position in society. The women’s movement of the 1960s had made many women aware of their right to independence and control of their own lives. Women joined unions and other organizations in greater numbers. The women’s movement also raised and debated issues such as wages for housework, pensions for housewives and public childcare.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       M) Considerable agreement existed in a wide range of areas: the prohibition of discrimination in employment policies on the grounds of gender or marital status, affirmative action, equal pay for work of equal value, maternity leave and benefits, adequate day care facilities, provision for health and safety, and protection against sexual harassment (骚扰) in the workplace. By 1994, 57 percent of mothers with children five years and under were in the labor force and the crisis in childcare services was a major issue. As the need for the two-income-earner family increases, so does the demand for parental leave and quality daycare programs that recognize women’s role in the labor force and men’s role in child rearing and household work.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       N) Achieving the goal of equality would require major social, political and economic changes in order to create structures such as parental leave and childcare programs that support women and overturn existing structures such as labor-force segregation and low wages that are disadvantageous to women. It would also require changes in attitudes that divide work in the labor force and work in the home into “women’s” work and “men’s” work.

       The time when it counted whether the worker took pride in the product of their labor is long past. The vast majority of jobs today are assembly line, office cubicle (小隔间) and service (servants really) tasks which, for the worker, are repetitive, boringly mind numbing, and prone to repetitive injuries. Meanwhile the wages attached to these “jobs” have not kept pace with inflation for years, meaning that more and more people every year are driven deeper and deeper into debt or poverty just to survive.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Besides, more and more employers these days are simply with bias and view workers as problem prone necessities that can be easily replaced at any time and whose wages are a cost factor rather than an investment in the product.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       It is time to think beyond mere “jobs” as the principle means of obtaining a “livelihood”. Nor should a “job” define a person’s value or relevance. Science and technology, robotics and automation, have been eliminating the human component from the “jobs” market at an ever increasing rate for decades. And that is a good thing. Yes, there will always be tasks that humans must perform and which cannot be entrusted to machines alone, but those tasks become scarcer every year.

       There is a rich, lively and engaging life to be found outside the workplace and a mere “job” and it is time we looked outside this box toward other ways that people can find value in what they do, such as volunteering, community projects, family care, amateur sports and an array of others.

      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Many immigrants who settled in the United States were poor. The country they came to was a wilderness. Land had to be cleared of trees in order to make farms; mines had to be developed; houses, shops, and public buildings had to be built. Everyone endeavored to earn their livelihood. Manual labor was highly valued. Thereafter it was the man who worked with his head to achieve success in business and industry who was esteemed. Now there is in America a curious combination of pride in having risen to a position where it is no longer necessary to depend on manual labor for a living and genuine delight in what one is able to accomplish with one’s own hands.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       The attitude toward manual labor is seen in an array of things in American life. One is invited to dinner at the home of a middle-aged couple. It is not only comfortable but extravagantly furnished together with beautifully landscaped gardens; yet the hostess probably will cook and serve the dinner. Additionally, she is prone to do much of the housework, and even though the husband may be a professional man, he talks about washing the car, digging in the flowerbeds, or painting the house. He often assists her in washing dishes and doing other household chores (杂务) aptly. The son or daughter who is away at college may get a summer job involving manual labor to earn next year’s school expense.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       It has been an American ideal to rise from a humble beginning to a better position. Therefore the “servant class” has not remained a fixed group. In fact, it has almost ceased to exist because people, who in earlier days might have been servants, now get higher wages working in factories. The majority of families cannot afford to pay what people who do housework or gardening charge for their services.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       The expense of household service and of skilled labor, such as painting and carpentry, and the tradition of working with one’s hands have contributed to keeping alive the spirit of “do-it-yourself”. Many articles in popular magazines are developed to instruction in gardening, carpentry, and interior decorating. The average American gets a good deal of pleasure out of telling others about his or her projects, exhibiting them for their neighbors, or taking them to the country fair, where they will surely win a prize.

       The time has come for humanity to journey to Mars. We’re ready. Though Mars is distant, we are far better prepared today to send humans to Mars than we were to travel to the Moon at the beginning of the space age. Given the will, we could have our first teams on Mars within a decade. The reasons for going to Mars are powerful.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       We must go for the knowledge of Mars. Our robotic probes have revealed that Mars was once a warm and wet planet, suitable for hosting life’s origin. But did it? A search for fossils (化石) on the Martian surface or microbes (微生物) in groundwater below could provide the answer. If found, they would show that the origin of life is not unique to the Earth, and, by implication, reveal a universe that is filled with life and probably intelligence as well. From the view point of learning our true place in the universe, this would be the most important scientific enlightenment since Copernicus.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       Earth’s atmosphere and environment in significant ways. It has become a critical matter for us to better understand all aspects of our environment. In this project, comparative planetology is a very powerful tool, a fact already shown by the role that Venusian (金星的) atmospheric studies played in our discovery of the potential threat of global warming by greenhouse gases. Mars, the planet most like the Earth, will have even more to teach us about our home world. The knowledge we gain could be key to our survival.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       We must go for the future. Mars is not just a scientific curiosity; it is a world with a surface area equal to all the continents of the Earth combined, possessing all the elements that are needed to support not only life, but technological society. It is a New World, filled with history waiting to be made by a new and youthful branch of human civilization that is waiting to be born. We must go to Mars to make that potential a reality. We must go, not for us, but for a people who are yet to be. We must do it for the Martians.
