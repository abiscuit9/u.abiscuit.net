      <div style="text-align:justify">
       There’s a mysterious person who’s giving people money. For two years, somebody has been leaving $100 bills in unusual places. Some people have found $100 bill inside pockets of clothes, inside pots or with boxes of food at the supermarket.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       When people realize the money is real, many of them cry because the money would help their financial situation. One woman said she found the money when her family was having a difficult time, so she appreciated the thoughtful action of someone she didn’t know.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Some people have done wonderful things with the money they found. One boy found $100 in a toy store, so he bought a lot of toys. But not for him. He bought toys for a children’s group who helps low-income families.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       People believe that at least $55,000 has been found, but they don’t know who this generous person is and may never know why he or she has been doing this.

       Chris King is happy about his two hands though they aren’t really his. A few years ago, Chris had an accident whilst at work and lost both of his hands.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Recently he had an operation to receive two new hands from someone who gave away his hands after he died. Chris is the UK’s second person to have an operation to replace a hand, but he is the first to receive two hands.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       His doctors say that the operation was difficult because usually most hands are completely replaced. However, in this case, Chris still had part of his hands, including his fingers, which made it very complicated and challenging. The operation was successful and Chris can already move his hands after only a few days.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Chris says the hands fit perfectly and he can’t wait to hold a beer, work in his garden and ride his bicycle. Also, Chris says that he is happy that he can now wear proper clothes with buttons.

       M: Wait, Let me tell you from the beginning, Mom. Step by step. First, at 3 P.M., I picked up the engagement ring from Tiffany’s on fifth Avenue here in New York City.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       W: Right, right, but did she say “yes”?

       W: “Scary me” instead of “marry me”?

       M: Well you know me, Mom, I worry sometimes. So, when I brought the ring out, my hands were shaking and sweating. I dropped the ring in the grass! Of course it was already sunset, and getting dark…. Couldn’t see it…
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       W: What? So you’re down on one knee, with an empty ring box in your hand, your brand-new engagement ring lost in the grass? What a disaster!

      <p style="text-align:justify">
       M: Well, almost. Molly looks at me, says: “Nathan, you’re holding an empty box and asking me to marry you?” I told her “Yes! – Trying to, at least!” You know Molly, always prepared, – pulled out a small flash light from her purse, found the ring, put it on her own finger. Said: “Yes!” Kissed me. Then, we both burst out crying.

       At the age of 14, most teenagers are thinking about friends, school, sports, and having fun in general. Jerika is thinking about dying. She isn’t sad about it; she’s ready for it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Since she was a baby, Jerika has had a serious medical problem that makes her body weak. Her brain can’t send messages for her body to move, so her body doesn’t really work anymore. She can move her hands and legs a little, but she has a hard time just holding her head up straight. She spends her days in an electric chair to move around and nights in her bed.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jerika will die soon, but she can’t bear the great pain anymore. She doesn’t want a machine to breathe for her, so in a few months, she will stop using the breathing machine and let her body decide when it is time to die. Now, Jerika is enjoying her last months of life. She’s had a large party with her friends and family and spent time dancing and laughing. They made her queen of the party. Her mother said Jerika has always been a happy girl and feels peaceful about Jerika’s decision.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Many people have wondered if a 14-year-old girl is able to make such a serious decision about her life. Jerika’s doctors have said that she is more mature and wise than most people think. The doctors also say that Jerika and her mother have done everything they could to improve the quality of Jerika’s life, and they honor her wish.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jerika thinks her story will be an important message about her disease and hopes her experience will bring attention to the disease and help find a cure to it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jerika will die, but she will face death with courage. The disease won’t control her destiny; Jerika will.

       <b>
        The Courage to Know Oneself
       </b>
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       A) I have had a lot of fear in my life. Much of the fear started when I was about nine years old and developed into an unbearable fear of dying. I would lie in bed at night, knowing that I was eventually going to lose everything I owned. Then I cherished life itself very much. “Why was I born if only to die?” was the question that plagued me. I literally could not sleep at night. And I could find no comfort from either of my parents. So I learned to deal with it by controlling my breath (I thought if I kept breathing, I would stay alive). This habitual activity deadened (使麻木) my spontaneity and inner freedom for decades to come.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       B) This issue wasn’t resolved until I finally faced death directly within myself and saw what I was really afraid of was not death, but aloneness – existential aloneness – being all alone forever. And when I opened to this aloneness, needing to know what it really was, my consciousness opened to my wholeness and my interconnectedness with all existence. And I have not been lonely or afraid in the way I used to be since that defining moment.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       C) This story exemplifies the underlying principle of courage. Having courage does not mean that one does not have fear. It means that one is willing to face fear – to face fear itself in order to know the truth about something. In a very real sense, one could say that fear is the separation from the truth, and that courage is the willingness to go through fear to get to the truth. All fears, then, refer back to the one fear that is our separation from the truth of who and what we really are – our true nature, our undivided and interconnected self.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       D) The word “courage” comes from Latin and French derivatives that mean “heart”. So when people ask me what courage is, I often tell them that it is heart-work, learning how to move through fear.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       E) Every little fear becomes a doorway to a larger, less fearful part of ourselves, if we can just allow ourselves to be open and vulnerable to it, curious about it – needing to understand it and having to know the truth. Every time we face a fear, we learn that we have the ability to move through fear, we become a little more courageous in our lives, and we get a little closer to the truth.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       F) I often say that the difference between a child and an adult is that the child retreats from fear – chooses to stay stuck in their fear of the fear whereas the adult faces fear – chooses to move through their fear of the fear, into and through the fear itself.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       G) So, in order to fully understand courage, we need to understand why we would choose to not face our fear, but to continue to be afraid of it. Why would we choose to stay stuck in a limited, tight, fearful place when we could be free and open and joyous?
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       H) This, of course, is a huge question. But I think there are a few key things we can see that will be very useful. The first question that arises in this inquiry is, “What is it that we’re really afraid of, anyway?”
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       I) There’s an old Jewish expression that translates roughly into “Don’t look too deep”. I think the expression is based on the belief that what is deepest inside of us is fundamentally not good – original sin (罪恶), the id, etc. So, if one should sincerely seek the truth, what he will ultimately discover is that one’s true nature is bad. And how could one live with that knowledge? And so we are afraid of looking into things for fear that we won’t like what we find. From my experience, however, what I have found to be deepest inside myself (and all beings) is pure love, compassion, wisdom, and understanding. It’s just a matter of looking deeply enough to see what’s there.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       J) We are also afraid of letting go of the known – what we have known. Even though we may be aware of our suffering, at least we are familiar with it. We may even have become comfortable with it in a peculiar sort of way. We have made a kind of pact with our suffering: “I won’t bother challenging you if you promise not to get any worse.” In essence, we are afraid to change because we have an unconscious belief that things will get worse if we let go of what we know. What I have learned, however, is that the only place where there is true peace is in the place of absolute letting go of what we have known. From this place, I am able to respond freely and directly to the circumstances of my life.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       K) We have taken on an identity, an image, a set of beliefs about what we and the surrounding world are all about. We see our lives through this set of beliefs. If we were to let go of these ideas about what reality is, we are afraid we would no longer know what is real. And that is a frightening prospect for us. We are afraid that our world would be chaotic and even terrifying. We are afraid that the universe is not a benevolent (慈善的) place.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       L) And so we cling desperately to a set of beliefs about who we are and what the world is. All the beliefs were created (primarily in an attempt to protect ourselves from experiencing pain) very early in our childhood, and are buried deep in our subconscious. These beliefs or self-images serve to separate us from the reality and are actually the source of all our fears and all our sufferings. It is only by challenging or inquiring into these beliefs that we can move through our fears and come to know our true, courageous, free, open, loving, and peaceful self. The great poet, Rainer Maria Rilke once said, “The spiritual path is one of being defeated by greater and greater beings.” In the process of inquiring into, seeing into and letting go of our false selves, one’s awareness opens increasingly to the beauty and awe that is always present.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       M) One could then say that courage is being more committed to knowing the truth than protecting one’s cherished ideas and images about oneself and the world. What beliefs do you cling to? And are you courageous enough to challenge them?

       Recently there has been a tendency to sympathize with thieves whose operations have been carried out on a grand scale, and no attempt whatever has been made to hold them responsible. Some of the most thievish (像窃贼的) transactions have flourished and are still flourishing. Their success and their wealth are the only things recognized. They are honored as financiers and men of affairs, looked up to and respected.

      <p style="text-align:justify">
       For the past two or three years working people who have made sacrifices to save a few pennies have been cheated most unmercifully. Their hard-earned savings have been stolen from them by every possible scheme from the obvious looting (打劫) of a bank to the higher and more artistic method of legalized high risk, complex financial products. Men high up in the financial world have lent their names to some of the most shady and notorious schemes that ever dishonored a community or a people. Because of this the most diligent and economical (节俭的) American people have been induced to place their hard-earned and carefully guarded savings in what they were led to believe was a safe investment, only to find out when too late that they had fallen into the hands of a gang of extremely respectable cheats. They cannot recover what they have lost.

       The thief is too powerful to be affected by the law while the victim is too weak to put its machinery in motion. It may be that the law is defective, or it may be that those having its machinery in charge are influenced by the wealth of the transgressors (违犯者). Whatever or whichever it is that is responsible ought to be investigated and the evil remedied.

       There is something grimly ridiculous as well as pathetic in the messy way we manage things in our crude attempt as civilization. While we are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars of the people’s money annually in improving the breed of pig, or in fighting cattle disease, we are neglecting the most valuable asset of all, the children of the nation. A million dollars of the people’s money can be spent upon a speedway so that rich people might have an opportunity of exercising their blooded stock, while not a penny can be found in the State appropriations (拨款) to find food for starving children.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       This foolish state of affairs was brought out in strong relief when the school teachers organized themselves into a relief committee to find ways and means for supplying food to the hungry children under their charge. This organization was brought about by the pitiable plight of the children, many of whom had become so weakened for lack of proper nourishment that they fainted at their desks while trying to study their lessons. The teachers have called their organization the “Children’s Relief Society,” and the day after the organization was perfected they were enabled to issue tickets to the most destitute (赤贫的) of the children which entitled them to immediate relief.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Besides this effort on the part of the teachers, emergency measures for the relief of hundreds of pupils in other schools have been adopted by the committee of school board members. The newspapers reported that relief came in this case in the form of two soup kitchens which were opened and equipped so as to provide for hundreds of the starving children.

      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Destitution has visited hundreds of families as the result of the business depression. Not only have the educational authorities taken up the matter, but various generous societies have begun active work for relieving the distress. All of which is excellent in every way, yet it is not enough; it does not go far enough, for it ought not to be left to charity, but ought to be made a State duty.

      <p style="text-align:justify">
       How is it that despite our amazing powers of production there are still hundreds of millions of people all over the earth in continuous want and poverty, and dangerously near the brink of starvation? What are the causes of poverty? Everyone is forced to realize and recognize its existence and no one has yet found a cure for it.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Every thinking man has realized that poverty and starvation are not inevitable in the scheme of things. On the contrary, the fruitful earth yields enough for every one of the human beings inhabiting its surface without the twisted distribution of nature’s generosity (慷慨). This twisting is caused by our crude and ill developed ideas of distribution and the improper ordering of human services. In the first place, these services can be hindered at their source, and among the factors that operate in this direction may be war, crime, lack of healthy supervision, insufficient attention to rising generations, monopolies (垄断) and various private ownerships that limit the usefulness of property, and neglected and wasteful destruction of property.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       In the second place, the great cause of poverty is unproductive consumption. Services become unproductive when they are devoted to supplying luxuries or an excessive quantity of necessaries, which may be summed up in a single word: waste. These are the primary causes of poverty; they are responsible for the presence of starvation.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Is there a remedy?
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       The elimination of waste through perfect production and distribution is a problem that is slowly but surely being solved by the great combinations of capital that have destroyed competition. These monopolies, selfish in the extreme and with no thought beyond profit at any price, are rendering us useful service by teaching us the importance of cooperation and cooperative methods. When these great industrial combinations, these wonderfully smooth running great business machines become the property of all the people and cease to be operated for private gain, a great step will have been taken in the direction of the solution of the starvation problem. When everyone will produce according to his ability and consume according to his needs, then, and not until then will poverty and starvation depart entirely and forever from the minds of men.
