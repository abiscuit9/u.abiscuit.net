       Every July 4th in New York, people come to eat hot dogs. A lot of hot dogs! On this day, a restaurant has hosted an international hot dog eating contest since 1972. Currently the largest number of hot dogs eaten in only 10 minutes is 73 for men and 45 for women.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       How is it possible for these competitors to eat so many hot dogs in so little time? Eating contests are actually considered a sport, and people train for these contests. To prepare for eating contests, many people chew food to strengthen their jaws, and they drink a lot of liquids to expand their stomachs to be able to hold a large amount of food. Sometimes during the contest, people jump up and down to help the food pass through their throats or push on their stomach to force the food down. Surprisingly, most of the competitors are actually healthy people.

       Supermarkets around the world are starting to use self-service machines. Instead of having a cashier charge for the products and collect the money, some stores have machines that the customers use to do the same thing.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This self-service approach is one way that companies can save money by not hiring as many workers, and it’s also a natural movement of technology into various areas of business. However, at this point, it doesn’t appear that the technology is helping the companies at all. In some studies, they found that there were a lot of situations where the customers did not pay for everything they took.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Researchers don’t know if people intended to steal the items or if they were not very good at checking all of their items, but if there’s a camera that shows what the customers are doing, there are fewer problems with unpaid products. However, some stores stopped using these self-service machines because they lost too much money.

       W: Hey Richard, I am so excited! This is our first trip to Los Angeles, California, and I can’t wait! Disneyland, here we come!!
      </p>
      <p>
       M: Well, you know, of all the Disneyland parks in the world, I have been to every one of them, except for the original one, the Disneyland here in southern California, which was built in 1955.
      </p>
      <p>
       W: I know! But, what is it about Disneyland that makes you so happy?
      </p>
      <p>
       M: Well, Mickey Mouse, of course! And, I guess … hmmm, you know, I think it’s because Disneyland helps me feel like a kid again with a simple, joyful experience!
      </p>
      <p>
       W: Well, I am really glad to be going to Disneyland with my favorite brother, then! But, hey! Let’s be sure to see some other things in southern California too!

       M: Sure! What do you want to see?
      </p>
      <p>
       W: Well, I want to go see the HOLLYWOOD Sign and walk down the beach at the Pacific Ocean. Most of all, I want to go and walk down to the street where there are many fancy shops. I love all those shops and want to look for movie stars who are shopping there!
      </p>
      <p>
       M: Wait! Wait! And, what about the old historic movie theaters where they always have the world movie premieres? Those theaters are amazing to see – and they have a lot of history, too! Like the Los Angeles Theatre. It is very famous. It was built in 1931 and has been showing movies ever since!
      </p>
      <p>
       W: And another theater we must see here in Los Angeles is a Chinese-style theatre which was built in 1926 and where you can see all of the movie stars’ hand prints and foot prints!
      </p>
      <p>
       M: Yeah, I think I know which one you are talking about. It was also the theatre that had the first showing of a very famous science-fiction movie in the 1970s, and it is called …
      </p>
      <p>
       W: …
       <i>

       M: Hello honey. I picked up pizza and a DVD on the way home. The DVD is that funny romantic comedy movie we missed in the theaters last summer. It’s called
       <i>
        Happy Times
       </i>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       W: Gosh, but I really want to go out to watch a movie in the theater tonight. Let’s go see the new adventure movie. It’s got good reviews, and it’s being shown at the Main Street Theater, which is quite close to home. We can watch the 8 p.m. one.
      </p>
      <p>
       M: I’m really tired … and, it is all the same – watching movies at home or going out to the theater – except for the money! Movies in the theater are so expensive, $10 per ticket!
      </p>
      <p>
       W: Well, no. I don’t think it’s the same at all. Watching movies at home on DVDs is all we’ve done for the past three months! It would be good to do something different. I love going out to the theater to watch movies with you: sitting close with you, sharing popcorn while watching the movie on a big screen. It’s so romantic!
      </p>
      <p>
       M: Well, OK. I do love going to the movies with you, too! Let’s compromise. The Main Street Theater has half-price movie tickets for movies that begin before 6 p.m.. So, how about an early movie sometime?
      </p>
      <p>
       W: OK! How about tomorrow? We can go tomorrow night to the movies at the Main Street Theater with the half-price tickets before 6 p.m.! There’s a 5:45 p.m. show time for the adventure movie!
      </p>
      <p>
       M: OK! That works! Tickets will only cost $5 each!
      </p>
      <p>
       W: Yes! And, we can have an early dinner at the new hamburger place next door to the Main Street Theater. It serves hamburgers of different flavors from all over the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       M: Mmmm. I’m hungry already! Dinner and a movie for $10, each! I like it! And it’s romantic, too!
      </p>
      <p>
       <br/>
       <p>
        Why does the woman insist on going out to the theater?

       <p>
        What does the man say about movies shown before 6 p.m.?

        How much will it cost for the two people to have dinner and watch an early movie?

      <p>
       M: I’m so proud of you! Tell me more!
      </p>
      <p>
       W: Well, women are, of course, half the people in the world, but they own only a tiny portion of its land. When women work, they earn less than a man does for doing the same job. And, women and children are 70 percent of the poor in the world, that is, they make up a major part of the people who live on less than $2 per day!
      </p>
      <p>
       M: Women and children are 70 percent of the poor in the world? Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       W: So, in deep poverty, when men do earn, they often do not invest their money in their families, but when women earn, most of the time, they invest most of their earnings – 80 percent of their earnings – in their families!
      </p>
      <p>
       M: Wait. Why would men in deep poverty spend less on their families than women?
      </p>
      <p>
       W: I don’t know! Studies show that men in poverty often spend their money on alcohol. But when women in deep poverty have opportunities to earn money, they spend their money on education, clothes and food for their children. So it’s really important to get opportunities for education and work for women. Wait. I forgot to ask …What’s your news?
      </p>
      <p>
       M: So, I found a sale on your favorite Jimmy Choo boots in red! Only $725. But maybe we should send the money to help poor women instead!

       Seat belts protect drivers and passengers in case of accident. They also reduce the effect of a crash on the body. Safety experts estimate that the restraining devices save more than four thousand lives a year in the United States alone.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The first seat belt was said to have been created in the 1800s by George Cayley of England. He is remembered for many inventions, especially for early “flying machines.”
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The United States first recognized the invention of an automobile seat belt in 1849. The government gave a patent to Edward J. Claghorn of New York City so that others would not copy his invention. Claghorn called the device a Safety-Belt.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But more than one hundred years passed before the current, widely used seat belt was developed. It resulted from the work of a Swedish engineer, Nils Bohlin. His three-point, lap and shoulder seat belt first appeared on cars in Europe fifty years ago.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       After completing college, Bohlin designed seats for the Swedish aircraft industry. The seats were built for the pilot to escape from an airplane in case of disaster. Bohlin’s work with planes showed him what could happen in a crash at high speed. In 1958, Bohlin brought that knowledge to the Swedish car manufacturer Volvo. He was the company’s first chief safety engineer.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       At the time, most safety belts in cars crossed the body over the stomach. A buckle held the restraints in place. But the position of the buckle often caused severe injuries in bad crashes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Nils Bohlin recognized that both the upper and lower body needed to be held securely in place. His invention contained a cloth strap that was placed across the chest and another strap across the hips. The design joined the straps next to the hip.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Volvo was the first automobile manufacturer to offer the modern seat belt as a pumanent addition to its cars. It also provided use of Nils Bohlin’s design to other car-makers.

       More surprising, perhaps, than the current difficulties of traditional marriage is the fact that marriage itself is alive and thriving. Americans are a marrying people – relative to Europeans, more of us marry and we marry at a younger age. Moreover, after a decline in the early 1970s, the rate of marriage in the United States is now increasing. Even the divorce rate needs to be taken into consideration in this pro-marriage context – some 80 percent of divorced individuals remarry. Thus, marriage remains by far the preferred way of life for the vast majority of people in our society.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What has changed more than marriage is the nuclear family. 25 years ago, the typical American family consisted of a husband, a wife, and two or three children. Now there are many marriages in which couples have decided not to have any children. And there are many marriages where at least some of the children are from the wife’s previous marriage, or the husband’s or both. Sometimes these children spend all of their time with one parent from the former marriage; sometimes they are shared between the two former parents.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Thus, one can find every type of family arrangement. There are marriages without children; marriages with children from only the present marriage; marriages with “full-time” children from both the present and former marriage; marriages with “full time” children from the present marriage and “part-time” children from former marriages. It is not all that unusual for a child to have four parents and eight grandparents! These are enormous changes from the traditional nuclear family. But even so, even in the midst of all this, there remains one constant: most Americans spend most of their adult lives married.

       A leading group of American doctors is warning against forcing young people to become skilled in a single sport. It says young people who play just one sport face additional physical or other demands from intense training and competition. It says children involved in sports should be urged to take part in different activities and develop many skills.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The group notes that more and more children are skilled in one sport at an early age. Some of the most famous athletes first became active in a sport when they were five years old. A few started even earlier. The group notes that the successes of young athletes can be a powerful example for others to follow. It says children wishing to compete at a high level require training that could be considered extreme even for adults. It says the necessary desire and intensity of training raise many concerns about the safety of high-level athletic activity for any young person.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The group says the health effects of intense training in young athletes need to be fully investigated. Risks to young athletes include injuries, eating disorders and emotional stress.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The group offers some suggestions. It urges children to become involved in sports at levels that meet their abilities and interests. It says doctors should work with parents to make sure that someone knowledgeable is training the child athlete. That person should know correct methods of training, equipment and the physical and emotional health of young competitors.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The group says doctors should supervise the condition of child athletes involved in intense training. It says doctors and trainers should work to prevent injuries that result from too much physical activity. Doctors should make sure the children eat a healthy, balanced diet. And doctors should watch for signs of too much training, including weight loss and sleep problems.

       People often ask which is the most difficult language to learn, and it is not easy to answer because there are many factors to take into consideration. Firstly, in a first language the differences are unimportant as people learn their mother tongue naturally, so the question of how hard a language is to learn is only relevant when learning a second language.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       A native speaker of Spanish, for example, will find Portuguese much easier to learn than a native speaker of Chinese, for example, because Portuguese is very similar to Spanish, while Chinese is very different, so first language can affect learning a second language. The greater the differences between the second language and our first, the harder it will be for most people to learn. Many people answer that Chinese is the hardest language to learn, possibly influenced by the thought of learning the Chinese writing system, and the pronunciation of Chinese does appear to be very difficult for many foreign learners. However, for Japanese speakers, who already use Chinese characters in their own language, learning writing will be less difficult than for speakers of languages using the Roman alphabet.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Some people seem to learn languages readily, while others find it very difficult. Teachers and the circumstances in which the language is learned also play an important role, as well as each learner's motivation for learning. If people learn a language because they need to use it professionally, they often learn it faster than people studying a language that has no direct use in their day to day life.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Apparently, British diplomats and other embassy staff have found that the second hardest language is Japanese, which will probably come as no surprise to many, but the language that they have found to be the most problematic is Hungarian. This does not mean that Hungarian is the hardest language to learn for everyone, but it causes British diplomatic personnel, who are generally used to learning languages, the most difficulties.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Different cultures and individuals from those cultures will find different languages more difficult. In the case of Hungarian for British learners, it is not a question of the writing system, which uses a similar alphabet, but the grammatical complexity, though native speakers of related languages may find it easier, while struggling with languages that the British find relatively easy.

       In 1976, Winkler wrote a
       <i>
        My Turn
       </i>
       about the overwhelming reaction to the character he played on the popular television sitcom (情景喜剧),
       <i>
        Happy Days
       </i>
       . The show was at its peak, and Fonzie was its superstar. In fact, Americans related so strongly to the character that Winkler became apparently permanently part of the country’s broad, extended family. Three decades later, fans still greet the actor with Fonzie’s signature thumbs-up sign and a long, drawn out “Aaay!”
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       “All these years later, the warmth I am treated with is unbelievable, and it’s all over the world,” Winkler says. He no longer receives the 50,000 fan letters a year that he got during
       <i>
        Happy Days
       </i>
       ’s original run, but they still come by the hundreds. And on the street, folks tend to have a common reaction. “They thank me for making them laugh for so long. They say, ‘I grew up with you,’ or ‘my children grew up with you,’ or, ‘we sat and watched it together’,” he says.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Winkler says his Fonzie days came back to him vividly as he read over his old
       <i>
        My Turn
       </i>
       . Cast on his 28th birthday, the Yale-trained performer had been a struggling actor, dreaming of fame. The dream turned real very quickly. “We were hardly on the air when this thing started to snowball, going from zero to 60 in about three seconds,” Winkler recalls.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Today, Winkler gives speeches to college students about living their dreams, focusing on how to become a successful actor. “If you are determined, have a sense of humor and never take your eye off what it is you want, you can actually have it,” he says.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Winkler is also at work on his first children’s book, co-authoring with Lin Oliver. He was recently named executive producer of
       <i>
        Hollywood Squares
       </i>
       and produces the show
       <i>
        Intuition
       </i>
       on the Game Show Network. His next movie,
       <i>
        Holes
       </i>
       , based on a children’s book, is scheduled for release this winter. In October 2000, Winkler made his Broadway debut costarring with John Ritter in the show
       <i>
        The Dinner Party
       </i>
       .
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       But through it all, Winkler remains Fonzie. “I think he is the architect of my home, of my professional life, and of my good fortune in the world,” Winkler says. “He literally is the foundation for everything that was to come.”

       My Neighbor has a gun. In fact, not having the good fortune to live in the last house on a dead-end street, I am surrounded by neighbors with guns. My situation is hardly novel, since most American households own at least one weapon. We now have enough privately owned guns to arm nearly every man, woman and child in the country. And some of those children are not just imaginary gun users, as recent statistics indicate.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       My neighbors’ guns make me nervous; I’m afraid that they might go off at the wrong time, pointed in the wrong direction. I’ve asked why such dangerous items are allowed to clutter up the house. I’ve gotten several answers, from constitutional rights to the innocent sport of blasting birds out of the skies. I’d like to focus on just one of these reasons.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       My neighbor tells me that curling up at night with his gun nearby makes him feel safer. Safer from what? A madman out to better the going entry in the “Guinness Book of World Records” for bloody brutality? My neighbor faces far less danger from the mentally ill killer, who fortunately is extremely rare, than he does from my other neighbor who also has a gun. Contrary to the public myth, mental patients have crime rates far below those of my neighbor or me; for all categories of crime and for homicide in particular. One of the few safe places left to live in this gun-packing country is on the grounds of your local mental hospital, where the residents are far less aggressive than my neighbor and guns are checked in at the gate.

       Safer from some intruder (侵入者) in the night seeking to deprive his wife of her virtue or him of his new color television? According to best available estimates, my neighbor’s odds of doing himself in accidentally with his own gun are about five times higher than his odds of being done in by some intruder. As a gun owner, my neighbor would be better advised to invest his money in locks and a loud dog. Actually, the intruder in the night accounts for fewer than three percent of our gun deaths. The bulk comes from perfectly law-abiding (守法的) but gun-toting (持枪的) people like my neighbors, who kill each other, themselves, or me.

      <p style="text-align:justify">
       A generation after Americans lost the habit of knowing who their space heroes really are, the Columbia astronauts were remembered Tuesday as awe-struck (肃然起敬的) youngsters who longed to “reach the stars”, and as fun-loving but dedicated adults who never lost their sense of adventure. President Bush and first lady Laura Bush attended a 45-minute memorial ceremony at the Johnson Space Center.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       The president and the chief of the astronaut corps helped bring the adventurous lives of the seven Columbia astronauts who died Saturday into focus for NASA employees and the nation. Navy Capt. Kent Rominger, the astronaut corps chief, remembered the crew as a ''generous and caring bunch with a great sense of humor''.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Bush also eulogized each astronaut. He spoke on a breezy, clear day as thousands of space program workers stood around a tree-lined pond. The televised ceremony was also broadcast for workers at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. ''Their mission was almost complete, and we lost them so close to home,'' Bush said. ''Their loss was sudden and terrible. And for their families, the grief is heavy. Our nation shares in your sorrow and your pride. And today we remember not only one moment of tragedy but seven lives of great purpose and achievement.'' Bush declared that the United States would continue its manned space program: ''This cause of exploration and discovery is not an option we choose. It is a desire written in the human heart.''
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Bush was accompanied to Houston on Air Force One with former senator John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth, and Neil Armstrong, the first man to set foot on the moon. The president arrived at the ceremony walking hand-in-hand with the first lady. Afterward, they met privately with about 40 family members. A White House assistant said Bush spoke to each person. He made small talk with the children about school and offered his regrets for meeting at such a tragic time. He told one widow, ‘‘you're a strong soul.'' He said to one father who lost a child, ‘‘we're so proud of you as a father. ''
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       The roar of NASA T-38 training jets that flew a ''missing man'' formation still echoed in the distance, as space agency workers leaving the ceremony said they had found comfort in the service.
