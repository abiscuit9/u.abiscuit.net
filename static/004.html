       There are thousands of actors, athletes and models who have careers in these fields but who are unknown. They are not famous even though they are successful. Being in these professions does not guarantee fame; they do not go hand in hand. Just because you work hard to succeed as an actor or athlete or musician or model does not mean you will find fame. You have to stand out from the crowd, you have to have something special about you, and perhaps most importantly, you have to be very lucky.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       So if your goal in pursuing any of these careers is fame then prepare yourself for disappointment. While fame MAY happen it is not a guaranteed part of succeeding in these careers. People who pursue these careers often have a passion for them, a deep love of music for instance, that keeps them going when things get tough. Without this passion you would hardly put up with the struggle. The entertainment and fashion industries are competitive. It can be difficult to get your foot in the door, let alone on the red carpet. Talent aside, without a deep devotion to your craft, success, with or without fame, is unlikely.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Now we can talk about what you need to do. First, find your talent. Can you act? Can you sing? Find whatever it is that lets you shine and run with it. If you can sing take singing lessons. If you can act, join a theatre group. Pursue your dream and don’t be put off by troubles, criticisms or rejections. These things are natural and normal parts of these professions and you need to be ready to deal with them.

       There are many perceptions of fame. Some may see fame as being a rock star, or a professional athlete, but some may have the same perceptions as me, and see fame as succeeding in what you do, being healthy, having a family, and loving what you do to make a living. Fame to me also means going to college, and continuing to learn throughout the rest of your life. You need to learn things all the time, and if you do not, then you cannot be the best you can be.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Fame does not come without the time, effort, and hard work put into everything that you do. Working hard does not always mean fame though. If you work hard and do not love what you are doing, then you are not fulfilling your fame, and you have not found your dream job. You need to push yourself to succeed in everything you do, you can always work a little bit harder, and there is always something more you can do.

       I see my dad as being the most famous person I have ever known. He was the guy that everyone wanted to know, because when he walked into a room, he just lit the room right up with his smile, and he could do this because no matter what mood he was in, he was always smiling, and making the best out of the situation he was given. This is why I believe that you don’t need to be on television to be famous, you can just be an ordinary person, but if you have a good effect on the people around you and your community, then you are famous to me.

        The Attack of the MOOCs
       </b>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align:justify">
       <br/>
       An army of new online courses is scaring the wits out of traditional universities. But can they find a feasible business model?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       A) Dotcom mania was slow in coming to higher education, but now it has the impressive industry firmly in its grip. Since the launch early last year of Udacity and Coursera, two Silicon Valley start-ups offering free education through MOOCs, massive open online courses, the ivory towers of academia have been shaken to their foundations. University brands built in some cases over centuries have been forced to consider the possibility that information technology will rapidly make their existing business model obsolete (过时的). Meanwhile, the MOOCs have multiplied in number, resources and student recruitment – without yet having figured out a business model of their own.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       B) Besides providing online courses to their own (generally fee-paying) students, universities have felt obliged to join the MOOC revolution to avoid being guillotined by it. Coursera has formed partnerships with 83 universities and colleges around the world, including many of America’s top-tier institutions.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       C) EdX, a non-profit MOOC provider founded in May 2012 by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and backed with $60 million of their money, is now a consortium (联盟) of 28 institutions, the most recent joiner being the Indian Institute of Technology in Mumbai. Led by the Open University, which pioneered distance learning in the 1970s, FutureLearn, a consortium of 21 British, one Irish and one Australian university, plus other educational bodies, will start offering MOOCs later this year. But Oxford and Cambridge remain indifferent and distant, refusing to join what a senior Oxford figure fears may be a “lemming-like rush” into MOOCs.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       D) On July 10th Coursera said it had raised another $43 million in venture capital, on top of the $22 million it banked last year. Although its enrollments have soared, and now exceed 4 million students, this is a huge leap of faith by investors that the firm can develop a feasible business model. The new money should allow Coursera to build on any advantage it has from being a first mover among a rapidly growing number of MOOC providers. “It is somewhat entertaining to watch the number of people jumping on board,” says Daphne Koller, a Stanford professor and co-founder of Coursera. She expects it to become one of a “very small number of dominant players”.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       E) The industry has similar network economics to Amazon, eBay and Google, says Ms. Koller, in that “content producers go to where most consumers are, and consumers go to where the most content is.” Simon Nelson, the chief executive of FutureLearn, disagrees. “Anyone who thinks the rules of engagement have already been written by the existing players is massively underestimating the potential of the technology,” he says.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       F) Certainly, there is plenty of experimentation with business models taking place. The MOOCs themselves may be free, but those behind them think there will be plenty of revenue (收入) opportunities. Coursera has started charging to provide certificates for those who complete its courses and want proof, perhaps for a future employer. It is also starting to license course materials to universities that want to beef up their existing offering. However, it has abandoned for now attempts to help firms recruit employees from among Coursera’s students, because catering to the different needs of each employer was “not a scalable model”, says Ms. Koller.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       G) For Udacity, in contrast, working with companies to train existing and future employees is now the heart of its business model. It has tie-ups with several firms, including Google. It recently formed a partnership with AT&amp;T, along with Georgia Tech, to offer a master’s degree in computer science. Course materials will be free, but students will pay around $7,000 for tuition. EdX is taking yet another tack, selling its MOOC technology to universities like Stanford, both to create their own MOOC offerings and to make physically attending university more attractive, by expanding existing teaching.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       H) Alison, an Irish provider of free, mostly vocational education founded in 2007, before MOOCs got their name, is generating plenty of revenue by selling advertising on its site. “Ads propelled radio and TV, why not education? There is a lot of misplaced snobbery in education about advertising,” says Mike Feerick, Alison’s founder.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I) Another important category of MOOC providers are publishers, says Rob Lytle of the Parthenon Group, a consultancy. He says firms like Pearson (part-owner of
       <i>
        The Economist
       </i>
       ) that run educational businesses such as textbook-publishing may thrive by offering free MOOCs as a way to get people to buy their related paid content.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       J) Besides the uncertainty over which business model, if any, will produce profits, there is disagreement over how big the market will be. Some see a zero- or negative-sum game, in which cheap online providers radically reduce the cost of higher education and drive many traditional institutions to the wall. Others believe this effect will be dwarfed by the dramatic increase in access to higher education that the MOOCs will bring.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       K) Mr. Feerick predicts that the market will be commoditised, spelling trouble for many institutions. But Anant Agarwal, the boss of EdX, reckons the MOOC providers will be more like online airline-booking services, expanding the market by improving the customer experience. Sebastian Thrun, Udacity’s co-founder, thinks the effect will be similar in magnitude to what the creation of cinema did to demand for staged fiction: He predicts a tenfold increase in the market for higher education.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       L) Sceptics point to the MOOCs’ high drop-out rates, which in some cases exceed 90 percent. But Coursera and Udacity both insist that this reflects the different expectations of consumers of free products, who can browse costlessly. Both firms have now studied drop-out rates for those students who start with the stated intention of finishing, and found that the vast majority of them complete the courses.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       M) Besides LearnCapital, a Silicon Valley venture firm, and the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation, the participants in Coursera’s $43 million fund-raising included Laureate, an operator of for-profit universities. Doug Becker, its boss, reckons that many established universities will soon offer credits toward their degrees for those who complete MOOCs. He thinks this will drive a dramatic reduction in the price of a traditional higher education, which will reduce the total revenues of existing providers by far more than the revenue gained by the start-ups. Still, if MOOCs reduce the cost of higher education by one-third, as he predicts, yet only earn for themselves one percent of that benefit, that would “still be a very nice business,” he says.

       Can you imagine life without French fries? Potatoes are very popular today. They are the fourth most important crop in the world, after wheat, rice, and corn. But in the past, potatoes were not always popular. People in Europe started to eat them only 200 years ago!
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       In the 1500s, the Spanish went to South America to look for gold. There, they found people eating potatoes for 7000 years! The Spanish brought the potato back to Europe with them. But people in Europe did not like this strange vegetable. Some people thought that if you ate potatoes, your skin would look like the skin of a potato. Other people could not believe that you ate the underground part of the plant, so they ate the leaves instead. This made them sick because there is poison in the leaves. Others grew potatoes for their flowers. At one time in France, potato flowers were one of the most expensive flowers.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Around 1780, the people of Ireland started to eat potatoes. They found that potatoes had many advantages. The potato grew on poor land, and it grew well in their cold and rainy climate. It gave more food than any other plant, and it needed little work. All they had to do was to plant the potatoes, and then they could do other work on the farm. On a small piece of land, a farmer could grow enough potatoes to feed his family. A person could eat eight to ten pounds of potatoes a day, with some milk or cheese, and be very healthy. Soon, potatoes became the main food in Ireland. In 1845, a disease killed all the potatoes in Ireland. Two million people died of hunger. Many Irish who did not die came to the United States at this time.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       In other parts of Europe, people did not want to change their old food habits. Some preferred to die of hunger rather than eat potatoes. Today, many countries have their own potato dishes. Germans eat potato salad, the United States has the baked potato, and the French invented French fries.
