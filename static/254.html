        The Health Benefits of Good Friends
       </b>
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       A) “You got to have friends to make that day last long,” sings Bette Midler. But good friends may help your life last longer, too, according to an Australian study. Conducted by the Centre for Ageing Studies at Flinders University, the study followed nearly 1,500 older people for 10 years. It found that those who had a large network of friends outlived those with the fewest friends by 22 percent.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       B) Why is this so? The authors think that good friends discourage unhealthy behaviors such as smoking and heavy drinking. And the companionship provided by friends may ward off depression, boost self-esteem, and provide support. Also, as people age, they may become more selective in their choice of friends, so they spend more time with people they like.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       C) Lots of research has shown the health benefits of social support. One such study, reported in the journal
       <i>
        Cancer
       </i>
       , followed 61 women with advanced ovarian cancer. Those with ample social support had much lower levels of a protein linked to more aggressive types of cancer. Lower levels of the protein, known as interleukin 6, or IL-6, also boosted the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Women with weak social support had levels of IL-6 that were 70 percent higher in general, and two-and-a-half times higher in the area around the tumor. In 1989, David Spiegel, MD (Doctor of Medicine), a professor of psychiatry at Stanford University, published a landmark paper in
       <i>
        Lancet
       </i>
       . It showed that women with breast cancer who participated in a support group lived twice as long as those who didn’t. They also had much less pain.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       D) Sheldon Cohen, PhD, a psychology professor at Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburgh, has shown that strong social support helps people cope with stress. “Friends help you face adverse events,” Cohen tells webMD. “They provide material aid, emotional support, and information that help you deal with the stressors. There may be broader effects as well. Friends encourage you to take better care of yourself. And people with wider social networks are higher in self-esteem, and they feel they have more control over their lives.”
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       E) Other studies have shown that people with fewer friends tend to die sooner after having a heart attack than people with a strong social network. Having lots of friends may even reduce your chances of catching a cold. That’s true even though you’re probably exposed to more viruses if you spend a lot of time with others. “People with more social support have fewer cardiovascular problems and immune problems, and lower levels of cortisol a stress hormone,” says Tasha R. Howe, PhD, associate professor of psychology at Humboldt State University. “Why? The evolutionary argument maintains that humans are social animals, and we have evolved to be in groups. We have always needed others for our survival. It’s in our genes. Therefore, people with social connections feel more relaxed and at peace, which is related to better health.”
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       F) “One thing research shows is that as one’s social network gets smaller, one’s risk for mortality increases,” says Holt-Lunstad, PhD, an assistant professor of psychology at Brigham Young University. “And it’s a strong correlation – almost as strong as the correlation between smoking and mortality.”
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       G) What about loners? Are they at greater risk of dying because they prefer to be alone? Only if they feel lonely. One study found that drug use among young people was higher among those who said they were lonely. Older lonely people tended to have higher blood pressure and poorer sleep quality. They also were more tense and anxious. Another study found that college freshmen who had small social networks and claimed to be lonely had weaker immune responses to flu vaccinations. They also had higher levels of stress hormones in their blood.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       H) Unfortunately, Americans have fewer friends than they used to, according to a recent study, “Social Isolation in America,” published in the
       <i>
        American Sociological Review
       </i>
       . The authors found that from 1985 to 2004, the number of Americans who feel they have someone with whom they can discuss important matters dropped by nearly one-third. The number of people who said they had no one they could discuss such matters with tripled to nearly 25 percent. The authors suspect that long work hours and the popularity of the Internet may contribute to the decline in close relationships. The study also found that the percentage of people who talk about important matters only to family members increased from 57 percent to 80 percent. Those who depend solely on their spouse for these talks increased from 5 percent to 9 percent.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       I) In general, women are better at maintaining friendships than men. Women “tend and befriend,” says Shelley E. Taylor, PhD, a psychology professor at UCLA. They respond to stress by protecting and nurturing others (“tending”), and by seeking support from others (“befriending”). This pattern regulates the seeking, giving, and receipt of social support, Taylor says. It produces health benefits by reducing psychological and biological stresses.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       J) And Margaret Gibbs, PhD, a professor of psychology at Fairleigh Dickinson University, found that men and women relate to others differently throughout life. “We found that women seemed more geared to empathy, while male friendships are more geared to companionship and altruism,” she tells webMD. “Male friendships are more about helping each other – mending the lawn mower, that sort of thing. Women’s friendships tend to have a more emotional content – listening to friends’ stories and coming up with helpful solutions.”

       Leadership is the ability of a person to guide people in a group toward achieving a task at hand. I believe that leaders are made; they are not born and a person can always be a good leader if he makes full use of the following list of leadership strengths.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       <br/>
       Firstly, task execution (实施) is one of the most important leadership strengths. Coming up with a brilliant idea and executing that idea are two completely different things. Bringing an idea to life is a lot easier said than done. An idea really comes to life only when it is executed to perfection. For this, you need to be a team player. There is a fine line between having followers that follow you out of respect and having followers that follow you because they have no choice. Any kind of disagreement in the team will affect the end result and the efficiency of performing the task.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       <br/>
       Secondly, before you go on to put any kind of strategy into place, you need to understand and
       <i>
        envision
       </i>
       what you wish to achieve. This is important because the expectations of the entire group will ride on your shoulders. Thus, one of the important leadership strengths is to have a very clear vision about how to go about a task at hand, keeping the long-term and short-term goals and consequences in mind. You need to be practical yet optimistic about the possibilities involved in any task and must take into consideration all the risks involved.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       <br/>
       Thirdly, being the leader does not mean that you own the people you work with. Many people tend to get carried away and do not listen to their team members. This can go against them as the team members then tend to lose respect for their leader. You need to genuinely listen to your team members because they are the only ones that will tell you if you go wrong at any point of time. Furthermore, listening will make sure that you connect with your team members on a personal level, which will improve the performance of your team greatly.

       Earlier this week the UK clinical psychologist, Professor Tanya Byron, warned that parental
       <i>
        paranoia
       </i>
       about child safety could expose children to greater risks indoors. She warned that by denying (拒绝) children the opportunity to play outside, they are likely to face greater dangers inside from the Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       <br/>
       As we can see, there are far fewer kids out and about on street corners or in parks unaccompanied by adults. Obviously, the drive to reduce risks in children’s lives has been firm.
      </p>
      <p>
       <br/>
       So, in trying hard to keep their loved ones safe, are parents denying children the freedom they need to develop and grow up? Quite possibly so. There is a real danger that by over-protecting and over-supervising (监督) children: Society could be denying children the opportunity to grow up into capable, confident adults. But we should not blame parents for this. Parents are constantly being overwhelmed with warnings about the dreadful things that can happen to their children if they do not keep a watchful eye on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       <br/>
       Now parents are asked to worry about the risks awaiting indoors when their children go online. But should they?
      </p>
      <p>
       <br/>
       A 2006 national survey of teenagers found that more than half (55 percent) of US youngsters between 12 and 17 years of age use social networking sites such as Myspace and Facebook. Tanya Byron admits that the “concrete evidence of harm resulting from the Internet is fairly limited”. Also, a literature review in 2008 shows that “there is a lack of information about any actual harm experienced by users of social networking sites”. So why all this fear?
      </p>
      <p>
       <br/>
       Of course, where there is freedom, there will always be “opportunities” for abusers and criminals. But every aspect of our lives poses potential risks, which ultimately we all need to learn to negotiate rather than try to eliminate. As Danah Boyd, a social media scholar,said at a conference, “There are potential risks on Myspace but it is important not to exaggerate them. The risks are not why youth are surging to the site. To them, the benefits for socialization outweigh the potential harm.” Boyd argued that, although letting go and allowing youth to deal with risks is terrifying for parents, “it’s necessary for youth to mature”.

       Between the 1950s and the early 1980s, the evolving role of Japanese women had been most obvious in their attitudes toward marriage and the family system. There had been a trend away from arranged marriages. Many young women admitted that they took paid employment mostly in order to find a husband on their own. In spite of this and other influences a 1982 figure showed that almost 40 percent of marriages were still arranged. This figure was, however, half the size of a 1955 survey which showed that almost 81 percent of marriages were arranged. Once married, many women in the early 1980s continued to work, and increasingly they returned to work after childbirth, something which was hard to imagine a generation before. A woman’s role in the family was evolving as well, becoming more and more dominant.
      </p>
      <p>
       <br/>
       Women had sought more personal satisfaction from their lives since 1950s. In the beginning of the1980s, during their lives before marriage women made up an almost free-wheeling (随心所欲) part of Japanese society. A survey of new brides reported that only 12 percent expected their marriage to be happy. At that time, Japanese still regarded marriage not as the peak of a romance but as a duty that was primarily social and practical in significance. As a result, Japanese women took full advantage of their years before marriage. Most women remained at home while working, living with their family in a sort of extended dependency. Japanese women, however, must be careful to maintain themselves within acceptable social standards, one woman being told, “If you act like that, you will not be wanted as a bride.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <br/>
       Once married a Japanese women found herself in a role opposite of the perceived sex roles in Japan – the female was dominant in the house. The relationship between the partners of a Japanese marriage clearly showed the evolving role of women. It must be remembered that a short one hundred years ago the attitude toward women was that “In everything she must obey her husband”. By the early 1980s the role of women had changed: A Japanese woman had almost unquestioned power within the family system of today’s Japan.
