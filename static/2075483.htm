                                <div style="text-align: justify;">Swimming is Yusra Mardini’s passion. Yusra was born in Syria, a country in the Middle East. As a child, she trained to be a swimmer until war came to her country. She couldn’t swim anymore and had to leave her country.
                                    With her sister, Yusra left Syria and headed towards Germany.&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;
                                    <br /> On the way, they crossed the Mediterranean Sea. Whilst they were crossing the sea, the boat motor broke, and a lot of water was coming in the boat. Yusra, her sister, and another young woman got out of the boat
                                    and began swimming. They were holding onto a rope and pulling the boat to the shore. They swam for over three and a half hours to save the people on the boat.&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;
                                    <br /> After Yusra arrived in Germany, she began to swim again. She was chosen to swim in the 2016 Rio Olympics. The Olympic committee wanted to give hope to all the people who were forced to leave their own countries.</div>

                                <div style="text-align: justify;">Many countries want to protect their ancient historical monuments from people who don’t respect them. One of the greatest and most recognizable ancient monuments in the world is the Great Wall in China. Unfortunately, people
                                    are damaging the wall. They are stealing the bricks of the wall to build their own walls, and some are even selling them to tourists.&nbsp; People are now more worried because there was a recent video of a man who was
                                    kicking and breaking the bricks of the wall.&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;
                                    <br /> The Chinese government doesn’t want more people to damage this important piece of their history, so they’ll try to protect and check the wall more regularly. There’s also a phone number so people can call to
                                    report any damage they see. The government realizes that it’s difficult to protect this wall because it’s over 21,000 kilometers long, but they wish to protect this heritage as much as possible.</div>

                                    My mum usually makes dinner, but she’s been quite busy these few days.<br /> M:&nbsp; Does she have a difficult job?<br /> W:&nbsp; It’s not that. She’s been busy because my little brother broke his left foot last week.
                                    She’s had to drive him everywhere like school and music lessons, so she doesn’t have time to cook a proper meal.<br /> M:&nbsp; That’s nice of you to help your mum.<br /> W:&nbsp; Honestly, that’s not my doing. I’d
                                    rather not cook, but my dad insists that I help my mum. I wouldn’t mind helping, but I’m so busy at university and my job at the library.<br /> M:&nbsp; That’s a lot of pressure on you, isn’t it?<br /> W:&nbsp; It is,
                                    but I can manage since it’s only for a short while. My little brother’s foot should be fine in about four weeks.<br /> M:&nbsp; So what’s for dinner tonight?<br /> W:&nbsp; Not sure. But certainly something easy. Got
                                    any suggestions?<br /> M:&nbsp; Me? Ha-ha. I’m the last person you want to ask. I don’t even know how to properly cook an egg. The last time I tried, I burnt it so badly that my mate thought the kitchen was on fire!<br
                                    /> W:&nbsp; So you never cook?<br /> M:&nbsp; Never! That’s why I asked if you wanted to go to the pub with me.<br /> W:&nbsp; That must get expensive to always eat out.<br /> M:&nbsp; It does, but what choice do I
                                    have?
                                    <br /> W:&nbsp; Learn to cook! It’s easier than you think.
                                    <br /> M:&nbsp; Would you mind helping me?<br /> W:&nbsp; I’d be glad to help, but you could also learn from watching videos on the Internet. There are also some great cookbooks.&nbsp;<br /> M:&nbsp; I suppose so, but
                                    I usually learn better if someone can teach me.<br /> W:&nbsp; OK, I’ll help when I have time.</div>

                                <div style="text-align:justify">There are a lot of unique buildings in the country of Dubai, and the tallest building in the world is located there. Now, Dubai has another very interesting style of building. Instead of reaching up to the sky, this new
                                    place is going down into the ocean. &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;
                                    <br /> Most people who are on holiday in Dubai stay at a hotel. Usually the hotel is on land, but a new project is building cottages that are partly under water. Each cottage has three levels, and the bottom level is
                                    completely beneath the sea. This bottom level has huge windows, which make it seem like you are standing in the middle of the sea.<br /> &nbsp;
                                    <br /> The architects had to be careful about the windows because they couldn’t use glass. The pressure under the water is too high and the glass would break. So they had to use a special type of plastic that is used
                                    in the sea. They also had to be careful about the furniture in the cottages because the salt in the water and the temperature can damage most materials.<br /> &nbsp;
                                    <br /> People may think that the cottage would be like a boat, and that it would move with the water. These people believe that guests in the cottage would feel sick if the sea is rough during bad weather. However,
                                    each cottage is connected to the bottom of the sea, and the architects designed the cottage to reduce movement.<br />
                                    <br /> It’s interesting that the chairman of the company that designed these cottages is afraid of the ocean, but he said that he was always very interested in what’s under the water. The architects say that the underwater
                                    rooms are brilliant. Each day the guests can see different fish and sea creatures swimming right outside their windows. It’s like waking up to a new world every morning.</div>

                                <p style="text-align:justify">After rising steadily for almost a century, standards of education in the public schools of Europe and North America have leveled off and, in the opinion of many parents and employers, are actually falling. More and more
                                    children are leaving school with little more than a basic knowledge of reading, writing and arithmetic, and illiteracy is becoming a social problem once again. With dropout rates of 27 percent in high schools and 50
                                    percent in colleges, the American education system is clearly in trouble. European dropout rates, though lower than those of the U.S., are rising too.<br />
                                    <br /> Various factors have been blamed for the apparent decline in educational standards. Some people say that overcrowding and lack of discipline are major factors. Others maintain that subjects like art and drama
                                    have been overemphasized at the expense of more practical subjects. The negative influence of television is frequently mentioned as a reason for growing illiteracy. Many teachers and principals, however, insist that
                                    the problem is not of falling standards but of rising expectations on the part of parents and employers.<br />
                                    <br /> Whether or not standards in public schools are actually falling, many parents feel that the only way to secure a good education for their children is to send them to private schools, which generally have smaller
                                    classes and stricter discipline. The popularity of such schools is growing steadily, despite the high tuition fees. In the United States, for example, thirteen percent of all school children attend private schools;
                                    in France, over sixteen percent do so.</p>

                                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Culinary Tourism and Regional Development</b><br /> &nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">A)&nbsp;Culinary (烹饪的) tourism, also referred to as wine and food tourism, is an area of tourism studies that has grown rapidly in recent years in terms of tourism research and education.<br /> &nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">B) What is most surprising with the number of books and articles produced in the area is not so much the amount that has been produced but that, given the centrality of food as a part of the tourism experience, it has taken
                                    so long to emerge as an area of scholarship. Undoubtedly several reasons lie behind the development of academic interest in culinary tourism including the development of studies of various dimensions of everyday and
                                    popular culture. However, also of great significance is recognition of the role of tourism as a response to economic restructuring in rural areas and as a means of regional development.<br /> &nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">C)&nbsp;Obviously not all food and tourism relationships can be described as culinary tourism. Instead, culinary tourism can be regarded as tourist and visitor activity that is primarily motivated by an interest in food.
                                    This can be both urban and rural in context.<br /> &nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">D) Nevertheless, culinary tourism is typically regarded as especially important in rural areas because the relationship between food and tourism represents a significant opportunity for product and marketing development
                                    as well as for rural diversification (多样化). Culinary tourism is often encouraged through the intervention of national and regional public agencies. Specialized food products offer the opportunity for the development
                                    of visitor products through rural tours, direct purchasing from the farm, specialized restaurant menus with an emphasis on local food, and home stays on such properties. In such circumstances it may also be possible
                                    to use tourism as a means of creating long-term customer relationships, so that the visitor continues to purchase food and wine from a region long after they have returned to their home environment.<br /> &nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">E) Culinary tourism may therefore be a significant contributor to processes of localization as a response to increased global competition. For example, outsider interest in local produce (农产品) may serve to stimulate local
                                    awareness and interest, and assist not only in diversification and maintenance of genetic diversity and varieties, but may also encourage community pride and reinforcement of local identity and culture.<br /> &nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">F) In addition, the development and promotion of regional food products have also become part of a process of the protection of geographical places through intellectual property law. The commercial concretization (具体化)
                                    of place identity in international trade agreements for wine and food also helps reinforce the place branding and marketing processes that are necessary to contemporary tourism.<br /> &nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">G) Nevertheless, as with any form of tourism development, culinary tourism may have disadvantages. Tourism has the potential to introduce undesirable pests and diseases to rural areas. Some producers may not be able to
                                    afford to diversify into tourism while for others their location or the seasonal nature of tourism and food production may not provide sufficient visitor opportunities. Most importantly, tourism needs to be seen as
                                    just one component of an overall development strategy for firms and places rather than an end in itself.<br /> &nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">H) A number of the above issues are examined in the present special issue. Two researchers named Mitchell and Hall provide an extensive overview of wine tourism research and highlight the contribution of the researchers
                                    to the field. They identify a number of significant themes that are also represented in other contributions. For example, the significance of networking as a component of culinary tourism related to regional development
                                    is picked up by Mitchell and Hall in their investigation of the New Zealand’s bread and breakfast sector’s utilization of local foods. Another important theme in the culinary tourism is the importance of branding and
                                    its connection to wine and food regions and the culinary heritage and institutions that help shape the place. These relationships are discussed not only by CheDeborah in relation to food production and tourism in Michigan,
                                    but also by Job Hubert and Murphy Ann with respect to wine and tourism in Germany’s Mosel Valley.<br /> &nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">I) Significantly, all of the studies in this theme indicate the role of authenticity and quality as a factor in culinary tourism. Whether it be for reasons of food miles, concerns over the quality of what we eat, the local
                                    is regarded as better because it’s somehow more real in their increasingly commoditized and standardized world of culinary production. Such concerns are not isolated to culinary tourism alone. The emergence of the Slow
                                    Food Movement, a movement striving to preserve traditional and regional cuisine,and the reemergence of farmer’s markets in many Western countries clearly reflect a growth in green consumerism that much culinary tourism
                                    also taps into.<br /> &nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">J) However, while the development of such consumer reaction represents opportunities for culinary tourism, it probably also represents a major future challenge for the role of tourism in rural regional development.<br />                                    &nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">K) If Slow Food can develop as a movement, then why not Slow Tourism? On the surface, this may look extremely attractive: Stay in a place longer and get to know the area much more thoroughly as a visitor that deliberately
                                    seeks to buy local stuff thereby ensuring that money stays within the destination economy longer.<br /> &nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">L) However, the Slow Food Movement also concerned with the distance that food takes to travel in many cases from producers to consumers when such food could also have been produced locally. In these cases it may be appropriate
                                    to both produce and purchase locally. But if we apply such case to the development of Slow Tourism, would that therefore mean that we should travel locally as well? Undoubtedly, if we are looking to minimize the negative
                                    contribution of tourism to global environmental change, that might be a very good thing with many urban hinterlands (内地) probably greatly benefiting economically from such a shift. Yet, perhaps ironically, such a shift
                                    in consumption patterns could prove disastrous for those rural regions that are outside of the day-trip zones of metropolitan areas and those rural regions that are most in need of the potential economic and social
                                    benefits that culinary tourism might bring .<br /> &nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">M)&nbsp;The growth in culinary tourism clearly has the potential to contribute toward regional development. But its benefits and costs are greatly determined by place and location and by the factors that are used to measure
                                    development success. The contributions to this special issue primarily highlight themes and issues that emerge at the destination scale, although Mitchell and Hall also note the importance of movement over time and
                                    space outside of the immediate tourism destination with respect to long-term purchase and biosecurity issues. The challenge for future research on tourism and regional development relationships is therefore to look
                                    at the potential implications of culinary tourism and other forms of tourism at different scales in order to better estimate the effects of tourism, not only for the destination but also for the route along which tourists
                                    travel and the generating regions they come from.</p>

                                    with dogs and cats during a baby's first year offers any protection from colds and resulting common ear infections.<br /> &nbsp;

                                    being healthy for about 73 percent of the time, based on weekly questionnaires, compared with about 65 percent of children with no dog contact at home.<br /> &nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">While the study tracked just under 400 babies, the researchers said the results were statistically significant because it relied on weekly questionnaires filled out by parents. Dr. Bergroth explained that children who lived
                                    in households where dogs spent 18 or more hours a day outside, showed the most healthy days, fewer fevers and the least use of antibiotics compared with babies with no dog at home. One theory is dogs that spend a lot
                                    of time outside likely bring more dirt and bacteria inside the home compared with dogs and cats that spend more time indoors, she said. Researchers believe that exposure to dirt and bacteria builds up babies' immune
                                    systems.

                                <p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier studies using smaller samples of children have shown conflicting results on the impact of animal exposure on infections and allergies (过敏症), though a study funded by the National Institutes of Health showed children
                                    exposed to two or more dogs or cats in their first year had lower chances of later developing all kinds of allergies than children exposed to one or no pets.</p>

                                <p style="text-align:justify">Before, during and after the recession, demand for one sort of worker has been persistently stronger: jobs that involve assisting or caring for other people—from fast-food workers to home-health assistant to nail polishers.<br
                                    /> &nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify">These occupations have one thing in common: They aren't easily automated (使自动化) or outsourced (转包) abroad. “You can't send people to China or India for a haircut,” says Israel Kakuriev, 37 years old, who has been cutting
                                    hair in midtown Manhattan for the past 20 years. Nor is there, yet, a robot that can cut hair or hold the hand of an elderly woman with Alzheimer's(老人痴呆症) or do all the work that flight attendants do.<br /> &nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify">The U.S. government releases its latest report on the job market Friday morning amid worrisome signs that economic growth is slowing well short of full employment.<br /> &nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify">But economists see a couple of longer-term trends. Dividing the workforce into high, medium and lower-skill workers, they note that around the world, demand for the most skilled and educated—from engineers to specialized
                                    factory workers—has been relatively strong. But globalization and technology have eroded demand for routine middle-skill, middle wage jobs: In factories, assembly jobs have been eliminated by automation or moved overseas;
                                    in offices, tasks once done by humans are done by computers and voice-response software.<br /> &nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify">At the same time, Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist David Autor notes an increase in personal-service jobs—the ones that can’t be done remotely from overseas and can’t easily be done by machines. To measure
                                    this, Mr. Autor and MIT’s Daron Acemoglu sliced the U.S. workforce into 318 occupations, ranked by skill and education. Between 1989 and 2007—just before the recession—they found a five percent increase in routinized
                                    production, machine-operator and office jobs—but a 36 percent increase in personal-service jobs and a 40 percent increase in top-of-the-pyramid jobs, such as managers, professionals and financial wizards (奇才).</p>

                                <p style="text-align:justify">Some prominent businesswomen believe they are being asked to disclose more about their personal lives as they climb the career ladder than their male counterparts (对应的人或事). One seemingly innocent but frequently asked question
                                    illustrates the keen interest in the balance that women have to achieve between their professional and private lives—“how do you make it work?” Campaigners say that this question would hardly ever be put to a man and
                                    that it implicitly raises doubts over women’s commitment to their professional lives.<br /> &nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify">Similarly, in a recent interview, one female chief executive declined to answer questions about her home life, saying her own achievements might then be attributed to having a supportive husband and family—or to being single
                                    or childless. Deborah Meaden, the entrepreneur (企业家) whose profile rose dramatically when she began appearing on a BBC’s popular television show, has developed strict boundaries around the parts of her life that she
                                    will and will not discuss. “I was fairly nervous about mentioning anything at the start, but I am clear now about what I will and won’t talk about,” she explains. “You will never see a picture of my home, but there
                                    are stories that I have decided I don’t mind talking about—like the fact that I keep pigs and sheep. Who my friends are and what I do in my private life is not public information,” she says.<br /> &nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify">But she believes that the scale of interest in her personal life is the result of her media career, as much as her gender. “There are more men in business and so it’s a fact that if you are a woman you are a rarity and
                                    therefore you will attract more interest. And there is interest in how your life works because the traditional form is that women look after the family. But a lot of business people go about their life without anyone
                                    being interested in their home life.”</p>
