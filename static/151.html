       On Feb. 15, 2011, an instant survey was carried out among 18 overseas postgraduate students: 11 students were male and seven were female. The purpose of the survey was to discover the views of the students on a number of matters of personal concern. The survey was conducted by means of a questionnaire given to the students to complete. There were five questions. The first question concerned favorite color, and the second, favorite number. The next three questions were all concerned with aspects of marriage. Number three looked at the ideal age to get married. Number four examined the qualities looked for in a partner. And number five asked about the ideal number of children. The main findings were as follows. Blue was the most popular color. This was followed by green and purple. There was no real significance in the choice of lucky number. About one third of the students said that they had none. 61 percent of the students selected the age group 26-30 years as ideal for marriage followed by 21-25 years. In looking at the most important qualities in an ideal partner, some respondents wanted the person to be intelligent, others chose natural, still others indicated attractive and honest. The ideal number of children was two followed by three. It is not easy to reach any definite conclusion based upon such a small sample of students from such widely different backgrounds. However, it is clear that the majority favor 26-30 as the ideal age to get married to an intelligent partner and have two children.

       Research studies of women in North America have found that women are far more likely to save for their children’s education and they are also more likely to save up in order to buy a house one day. The same studies have found that men, on the other hand, tend to save for a car. When they’re earning, they’re far more likely to put money aside for their old age than women are.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This is rather disturbing because the need for women to save for their old age is far greater than for men. To start with, it is a fact that throughout the world, women are likely to live longer than men, so they need money to support themselves during this time. Furthermore the high divorce rates in North America are creating a poverty cycle for women. It is the divorced women who will most often have to look after the children and thus they need more money to look after not just themselves but others.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       So what can be done about this situation? The research indicates that women today need to look ahead, think ahead, and not wait until they’re under pressure. It also suggests that women avoid dealing effectively with their economic situation because of a lack of confidence. The best way for them to overcome this is by getting themselves properly informed so they are less dependent on other people’s advice. A number of initiatives have been set up to help women do this. Here, they can be given advice on different ways of saving. Many women are unwilling to invest in stocks and shares, for instance, but these can be extremely profitable. It is usually advised that at least 70 percent of a person’s savings should be in low-risk investments but for the rest, financial advisors often advise taking some well-informed risks. Initiatives such as this can give women the economic skills and knowledge they need for a comfortable, independent retirement.

        Coming to Amrika

      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       A) When Manoj Shyamalan was growing up in suburban Philadelphia, his parents – both immigrants from India, both physicians – didn’t hesitate to pile on the pressure. He was expected to come in first in his class and also follow them into medicine. When he announced his decision to study film at New York University, they were horrified. But few individuals with such an all-American ambition have been rewarded so quickly. In 1997, Disney paid him $2.5 million for the screenplay of
       <i>
        The Sixth Sense
       </i>
       and let him direct as well. Released last year, the ghost tale has earned more than $325 million and yielded eight Academy Award nominations. Shyamalan’s parents are greatly relieved.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       B) But now Shyamalan, 29, carries an even greater burden of expectation: rooting for him to win the best-director Oscar on March 26 will be 722,000 Indian immigrants and guest workers scattered across the United States for whom he has become a symbol of the success they hope to achieve.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       C) These days they have plenty of other role models. Two decades ago, Indians in the US were usually found in scrubs (手术服) in emergency rooms or changing sheets in family-owned motels. Today they are out of the mop closet and climbing onto top rungs (级别) in just about every industry. Indians are managing Fortune 500 companies, or, as consultants and securities analysts, telling others how to do so. Wall Street has their share, so too the media. And Silicon Valley is awash with subcontinental surnames.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       D) Indians have become one of the most successful immigrant groups in US history. The strengths that Indian migrants brought with them, such as education and a command of English, and the factors that made them leave their homeland tell only half of the story. Equally important is what those thousands of ambitious, uprooted souls found upon reaching America or Amrika, as they like to call it: an economic system open to anyone from anywhere. Indians now have one of the highest per capita incomes of any immigrant group in the US.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       E) How did Indians, in such a short time, reach such a critical mass in America’s professions and industry? One seemingly obvious factor – a large head count – can, in fact, be ruled out. The subcontinent may seem like a Niagara Falls of potential immigrants, a notion reinforced by the endless lines surrounding US consulates (领事馆) from Karachi to Dhaka.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       F) But if anything, the number of Indian transplants has been comparatively modest. According to the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington, DC, the US currently has 28.4 million immigrants. India’s contribution is only one million, far behind Mexico’s 7.9 million or the 1.2 million from the Philippines. Some 15,000 to 20,000 Indians receive student visas from the US each year, and many manage to land jobs after graduation and stay on. The only category in which India really leads the numbers is for H-1B visas, granted to workers with specialty occupations. Indians take up about 20 percent of all the H-1B visas issued each year, by far the largest proportion.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       G) Other numbers tell an even more amazing story. Only six percent of Indian immigrants live below the poverty line, compared with 31 percent of Mexicans and eight percent of transplants from Britain. When it comes to welfare and food stamps, Indians are the most self-sufficient in the entire immigrant pool. Fewer than one percent use public assistance; the figure for the next most self-reliant group, Filipinos, is nearly four percent. Indians have had greater success in a shorter amount of time than any other ethnic group in America.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       H) It wasn’t always this easy. Amar Bose, perhaps the best-known Indian-American in the US thanks to the stereo speakers he designed, was born in 1929 in Philadelphia to an immigrant businessman father and US-born mother. He recalls the bad old days of discrimination. “The big problem was color, pure and simple,” he says. “There wasn’t a restaurant in Philadelphia where I could be served. In those days you couldn’t even rent a house.” The first big change came in 1965, when immigration statutes (法规) were liberalized to attract scientists and engineers to work in an American economy accelerated by the Vietnam War. They fanned out to aircraft companies, NASA, the defense establishment, universities. Doctors were needed for President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society medical programs.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       I) Another asset for Indian immigrants was support from other family members. Vijay Goradia, who migrated from Bombay in 1977 and now has a private petrochemical business in Houston, Texas with more than $600 million in revenues last year, says he could afford to be courageous in his career because two brothers had preceded him to the States and served as his safety net. “It gives you the spirit to be free, to take chances,” he says. Hasmukh Rama came in 1969 with $2 in his pocket. He waited tables at a Howard Johnson’s restaurant and, in 1973, bought a hotel in Pomona, California. He couldn’t afford much staff, so his wife and brother helped run the place. Rama now owns or operates more than 20 hotels scattered across five states. “Only in America,” he laughs.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       J) Education is a traditional charm for immigrants in America, but usually as an aspiration for the second generation. In the case of Indian immigrants, it is often education that gets them out of India in the first place and a large number consider American education a bit wanting. The academic success is the best weapon for immigrants and their children to get ahead. “I always knew that if I fell short of a PhD or an MBA, I had better have a good explanation,” says writer Gawande.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       K) There’s another unique aspect to the Indian-American community. Immigration is normally equated with entrepreneurship: foreigners filling tiny niches (合适的职位) that American-born people wouldn’t spot, often catering to their own communities. But people from the subcontinent have tended to aim for mainstream jobs, either in the professions or in corporations, a legacy from British colonial times when a job in the civil service was the ultimate badge of accomplishment and security – a sentiment still strong on the subcontinent. More positively, Indian immigrants say they fit into corporate America because they speak English, unlike migrants from China, say, or the Republic of Korea.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       L) K. S. Ramakrishna, raised in the southern state of Karnataka, got an MBA from Ohio’s Case Western Reserve University in 1990, but was forced to return home when his family business ran into difficulties. He did his duty straightening out (整理) the firm – it makes electric cables – but was disgusted by the local business culture: the complacency, corruption and lack of vision. He has now started his own business, growing roses for export, and he senses that opportunities abound. “For me to start up a business in America, I’d have to come up with some brilliant idea,” he says. “Here it’s so simple: You find an idea abroad, modify it for Indian conditions and you make money.” It has been an amazing journey: Indians have traveled halfway around the globe to enrich both themselves and their adopted land. With a little bit of luck, they may turn out to be one of their homeland’s greatest future assets.

       According to the new school of scientists, technology is an overlooked force in expanding the horizons of scientific knowledge. Science moves forward, they say, not so much through the insights of great men of genius as because of more ordinary things like improved techniques and tools. In short, a leader of the new school contends (声称), the scientific revolution, as we call it, was largely the improvement and invention and use of a series of instruments that expanded the reach of science in innumerable (无数的) directions.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Over the years, tools and technology themselves as a source of fundamental innovation (创新) have largely been ignored by historians and philosophers of science. The modern school that hails technology argues that such masters as Galileo, Newton, Maxwell, Einstein, and inventors such as Edison attached great importance to, and derived great benefit from, craft information and technological devices of different kinds that were usable in scientific experiments.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       The core of the argument of a technology-yes, genius-no advocate was an analysis of Galileo’s role at the start of the scientific revolution. The wisdom of the day was derived from Ptolemy, an astronomer of the second century, whose elaborate system of the sky put Earth at the center of all heavenly motions. Galileo’s greatest glory was that in 1609 he was the first person to turn the newly invented telescope on the heavens to prove that the planets revolve around the sun rather than around the earth. But the real hero of the story, according to the new school of scientists, was the long evolution in the improvement of machinery for making eyeglasses.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Federal policy is necessarily involved in the technology vs. genius dispute. Whether the Government should increase the financing of pure science at the expense of technology or vice versa (反之) often depends on the issue of which is seen as the driving force.
