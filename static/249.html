      </p>

       The family in Britain is changing. The once typical British family headed by two parents has undergone substantial changes during the twentieth century. In particular there has been a rise in the number of single-person households, which increased from 18 to 29 percent of all households between 1971 and 2002. By the year 2020, it is estimated that there will be more single people than married people. Fifty years ago this would have been socially unacceptable in Britain.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       In the past, people got married and stayed married. Divorce was very difficult, expensive and took a long time. Today, people’s views on marriage are changing. Many couples, mostly in their twenties or thirties, live together without getting married. Only about 60 percent of these couples will eventually get married.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       In the past, people married before they had children, but now about 40 percent of children in Britain are born to unmarried parents. In 2000, around a quarter of unmarried people between the ages of 16 and 59 was living together in Great Britain. Before 1960 this was very rare. People are generally getting married at a later age now and many women do not want to have children immediately. They prefer to concentrate on their jobs and put off having babies until their late thirties. The number of single-parent families is increasing. This is mainly due to more marriages ending in divorce, but some women are also choosing to have children as a single parent without being married.

       It’s an ordinary day. You may be entirely relaxed, settling down to watch some TV. Suddenly you begin to feel scared. Everything around you is becoming unreal. Your heart is racing, your head spinning, your hands shaking. An overwhelming sense of despair and pain hits you like a wave. What on earth is going on?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       If you have ever had an experience like this, it’s possible that you were having a “panic attack”. Some people experience panic attacks in tense situations, such as before giving a speech. For others it comes completely unexpectedly. But a panic attack is a very real condition, and not at all the same thing as just getting upset and confused. So what causes it?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Panic attacks begin in the oldest parts of our brain. Before we had evolved rational thought, we still needed to be able to survive in the world. The ability to either fight or flee from a dangerous situation is perhaps the most basic behavior required of any animal.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Panic attacks occur when the body systems responsible for dealing with dangerous situations kick in at the wrong time. There is no danger in relaxing on your couch, and no real danger in giving a speech. But in some people, the “fight or flight” responses can be provoked accidentally. Heart rate increases, breathing becomes shallow, and adrenaline shoots to your arms. These are useful responses to have, if you really are in danger. For people who experience a panic attack, though, they can be both confusing and terrifying.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Several different therapies now exist for panic attacks, ranging from a set of anti-anxiety medicines to behavior modification. So take heart—there’s no need to panic.

        Michael Jordan
       </b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       <br/>
       A) Michael Jordan, American professional basketball player, is considered by many to be the greatest one in basketball history. The six feet six inches (198cm) shooting guard led the Chicago Bulls to six NBA championships. His widespread appeal to fans helped make basketball one of the world’s most popular spectator sports.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       B) Michael Jordan was born in Brooklyn, New York, the fourth of five children. Before his basketball skills emerged, young Michael liked to play baseball with his father. When Jordan attended Laney High School, at first he failed to make the varsity (校队) basketball team. The school’s basketball coach decided that Jordan could improve his skills with more playing time on the junior varsity team. As a sophomore on the junior varsity, Jordan averaged about 20 points per game.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       C) During this early period in his career, Jordan’s brother Larry contributed much to his development as a player. Although Larry was only five feet seven inches (170cm) tall, he regularly beat Michael in one-on-one games and taught Michael about the importance of competition. By the time high school started the next fall, Jordan had grown to six feet three inches (191cm) and was confident he would make the varsity squad.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       D) As a high school junior, Jordan did make the Laney varsity and was a valuable member of the squad. He then attended the nationally renowned Five-Star Basketball Camp during the summer before his senior season. Before graduating from the high school, Jordan met legendary University of North Carolina (UNC) coach, Dean Smith, who began recruiting Jordan for college. In November 1980 Jordan signed a letter of intent to attend UNC. Before the start of his professional career, Jordan played on the United States national team at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, California. He served as captain of the talented amateur squad.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       E) The Chicago Bulls selected Jordan in the 1984 NBA draft (选秀) as the third overall pick. During his rookie year, Jordan led the team in points (28.2), rebounds (6.5), assists (5.9), and steals (2.4) per game. His performance earned him the Rookie of the Year Award, a spot on the All-Star team, and a place on the all-rookie team, but Chicago lost in the first round of the playoffs. The pattern of spectacular individual performances but disappointing playoff losses was repeated over Jordan’s next five seasons. He astounded fans and players alike with his play, but the Bulls were obstructed in the play-offs. One problem was that Jordan sometimes played at a level so above his teammates that the Bulls failed to function as a team.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       F) The following season, Jordan continued his scoring feats and ended the season with 3,041 points and 37.1 points per game average, becoming only the second player after Wilt Chamberlain to score more than 3,000 points in a single season. The totals also earned Jordan the first of seven consecutive scoring titles.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       G) Jordan’s status as an NBA superstar was cemented when he won the slam-dunk (扣篮) contest during the 1988 All-Star Game. His leap from the free-throw line for a dunk elevated his popularity beyond the expectations of the league. Jordan also boosted the popularity of the Nike shoe company and other sponsors with his sincere, plainspoken endorsements. Jordan’s appeal as a basketball player and spokesperson was especially strong among children and teenagers. Jordan’s Nike basketball shoes and T-shirts with his number (23) became popular. Many advertisements focused on Jordan’s determination to succeed and encouraged kids to “be like Mike”.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       H) Before the start of the 1989-90 season, the Bulls’ assistant coach Phil Jackson was promoted to the head coaching position. Jackson introduced the so-called triangle offense, which allowed Jordan to use his incredible offensive talents while also involving his teammates. The triangle offense focused on passing and balancing the players across the floor. This strategy meant that the Bulls could still benefit from Jordan’s play-making skills, but at the same time it encouraged his teammates to play aggressively as well.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       I) As he grew older, Jordan made a concerted effort to help his teammates reach their own potential. The result of his renewed commitment to team-oriented play was the Bulls’ first NBA championship title. After the 1990-91 season the Bulls swept the Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals and then defeated the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals. Jordan won the League MVP Award for the second time and was named MVP of the championship series. In 1992 professional players were allowed to compete in Olympic basketball, and Jordan starred on the US national team, known as the Dream Team, that dominated the Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain. He teamed with other top-level players from the NBA to win the gold medal.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       J) On the eve of the 1993-94 season, Jordan shocked the sports world by announcing his retirement from basketball, stating that he had lost his desire to play the sport. After three consecutive NBA titles with the Bulls, Jordan himself cited a lifelong dream to play baseball for his abrupt career change.
       <br/>
      </p>

       K) Jordan ended his retirement from professional basketball by rejoining the Bulls with 17 games left in the 1994-95 season. In 1995-96, Jordan returned to his preretirement form. He again wore uniform number 23, which had been retired in 1994, and he led his team to an NBA record 72-10 win-loss record during the regular season, and the Bulls went on to win their fourth championship in six years.

      <p style="text-align:justify">
       L) During the 1999-2000 season, Jordan returned to basketball again after his second retirement, when he became part-owner and president of basketball operations for the Washington Wizards. But the Wizards suffered through several miserable seasons and unsuccessful coaches, and Jordan grew frustrated watching the team lose. In September 2001 he announced his second comeback as a player.

      <p style="text-align:justify">
       M) During his first season back Jordan showed flashes of his former brilliance, spurring his team to a newly competitive level. By midseason, however, his knees hurt and Jordan decided to have surgery in February 2002. During the 2002-03 season Jordan played in every game and averaged 20 points per contest. However, Jordan retired for the third time at the end of the season. He did so with the highest scoring average (30.1 points per game) in NBA history.

      <p style="text-align:justify">
       N) Jordan was the driving force that kept basketball’s appeal fresh in the early 1990s. The Bulls’ domination of the NBA under Jordan’s leadership captured the imagination of many people, and his athletic skills, charisma (个人魅力), and competitive drive created new basketball fans as few other players have. Jordan’s popularity has spread well beyond scoring titles, championships, and other aspects of the NBA. He has become one of the most recognized individuals in the world. Jordan has been especially influential in the sportswear industry. Nike created a separate business unit known as the Jordan brand to market footwear and apparel that Jordan himself helped design.

       In 1976, Winkler wrote a
       <i>
        My Turn
       </i>
       about the overwhelming reaction to the character he played on the popular television sitcom (情景喜剧),
       <i>
        Happy Days
       </i>
       . The show was at its peak, and Fonzie was its superstar. In fact, Americans related so strongly to the character that Winkler became apparently permanently part of the country’s broad, extended family. Three decades later, fans still greet the actor with Fonzie’s signature thumbs-up sign and a long, drawn out “Aaay!”
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       “All these years later, the warmth I am treated with is unbelievable, and it’s all over the world,” Winkler says. He no longer receives the 50,000 fan letters a year that he got during
       <i>
        Happy Days
       </i>
       ’s original run, but they still come by the hundreds. And on the street, folks tend to have a common reaction. “They thank me for making them laugh for so long. They say, ‘I grew up with you,’ or ‘my children grew up with you,’ or, ‘we sat and watched it together’,” he says.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Winkler says his Fonzie days came back to him vividly as he read over his old
       <i>
        My Turn
       </i>
       . Cast on his 28th birthday, the Yale-trained performer had been a struggling actor, dreaming of fame. The dream turned real very quickly. “We were hardly on the air when this thing started to snowball, going from zero to 60 in about three seconds,” Winkler recalls.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Today, Winkler gives speeches to college students about living their dreams, focusing on how to become a successful actor. “If you are determined, have a sense of humor and never take your eye off what it is you want, you can actually have it,” he says.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Winkler is also at work on his first children’s book, co-authoring with Lin Oliver. He was recently named executive producer of
       <i>
        Hollywood Squares
       </i>
       and produces the show
       <i>
        Intuition
       </i>
       on the Game Show Network. His next movie,
       <i>
        Holes
       </i>
       , based on a children’s book, is scheduled for release this winter. In October 2000, Winkler made his Broadway debut costarring with John Ritter in the show
       <i>
        The Dinner Party
       </i>
       .
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       But through it all, Winkler remains Fonzie. “I think he is the architect of my home, of my professional life, and of my good fortune in the world,” Winkler says. “He literally is the foundation for everything that was to come.”
