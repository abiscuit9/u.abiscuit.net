      <div style="text-align:justify">
       When we think about famous athletes in the US, we don’t think about university-educated, intelligent people. Most professional athletes have no reason to go to college since they can make millions of dollars each year playing on a professional team. However, once in a while, there is an athlete that doesn’t fit our perceptions. One athlete is professional basketball player, Jeremy Lin.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jeremy was born in California and was captain of his high school basketball team. He was accepted to many universities but chose to attend Harvard because they offered him a position on their basketball team. During his years at Harvard, Jeremy broke many basketball records. After four years, Jeremy graduated from Harvard University in 2010 with a degree in economics.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       However, he didn’t want a job in this field; instead, he chose to play professional basketball. He played for a New York team in 2012 but didn’t play very much at first. After he had the opportunity to play in more games, Jeremy became very popular and famous in just a few short weeks. During those few weeks, Jeremy played outstanding basketball. In one game, he scored more points than superstar Kobe Bryant.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       His picture was on the cover of many newspapers and magazines. Television news also spent a lot of time showing his amazing abilities. Jeremy also became more valuable. After his success, he was given a four-year contract worth almost 30 million dollars. Since he earned a lot of money as a professional basketball player, it’s unclear if he’ll ever use his Harvard degree. However, his time at Harvard helped him form the leadership skills he needed to be successful in basketball. His degree will also give him the ability to have a successful career when he is unable to play basketball anymore.
      </div>
      <p>
       <br/>
       <p>
        Why did Jeremy choose to attend Harvard?
       </p>
       <p>
        When did he score more points than superstar Kobe Bryant?
       </p>
       <p>
        How did his time at Harvard help him?

       There are a lot of unique buildings in the country of Dubai, and the tallest building in the world is located there. Now, Dubai has another very interesting style of building. Instead of reaching up to the sky, this new place is going down into the ocean.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Most people who are on holiday in Dubai stay at a hotel. Usually the hotel is on land, but a new project is building cottages that are partly under water. Each cottage has three levels, and the bottom level is completely beneath the sea. This bottom level has huge windows, which make it seem like you are standing in the middle of the sea.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The architects had to be careful about the windows because they couldn’t use glass. The pressure under the water is too high and the glass would break. So they had to use a special type of plastic that is used in the sea. They also had to be careful about the furniture in the cottages because the salt in the water and the temperature can damage most materials.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       People may think that the cottage would be like a boat, and that it would move with the water. These people believe that guests in the cottage would feel sick if the sea is rough during bad weather. However, each cottage is connected to the bottom of the sea, and the architects designed the cottage to reduce movement.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It’s interesting that the chairman of the company that designed these cottages is afraid of the ocean, but he said that he was always very interested in what’s under the water. The architects say that the underwater rooms are brilliant. Each day the guests can see different fish and sea creatures swimming right outside their windows. It’s like waking up to a new world every morning.

       M: I’m trying to quit smoking, but it’s so difficult!
       <br/>
       W: That’s because your brain makes you desire the chemicals in the cigarettes.
       <br/>
       M: How does it do that?
       <br/>
       W: There’s a part of your brain that makes you want more of something. When that becomes excessive, it’s called addiction. If you have an addiction, your brain is telling you to find more of what it wants. For example, you can have an addiction to cigarettes or food, and this means you constantly want to smoke or eat because of your brain.
       <br/>
       M: I thought it was because I wasn’t strong enough to fight my desire.
       <br/>
       W: That’s what people used to think. They thought people were weak and couldn’t stop themselves because they had no self-control. But doctors now understand that some brains have a system that creates addiction.
       <br/>
       M: How does it work?
       <br/>
       W: The brain releases a chemical when it feels pleasure. So when you eat a delicious cake, your brain sends out a chemical as a reward. Each time you experience this pleasure, your brain releases more of the chemical.
       <br/>
       M: What does the chemical do?
       <br/>
       W: It takes over the brain, so the other brain chemicals that would tell us to stop eating cakes aren’t effective anymore.
       <br/>
       M: So it’s not about self-control or being weak?
       <br/>
       W: Not really. It’s difficult to control when the brain is sending chemical signals that make your body feel pleasure. The problem is that when we experience this pleasure too much, we get used to it. So if you eat one cake at first, soon you’ll need two cakes to feel the same pleasure.
       <br/>
       M: Is that why people become overweight?
       <br/>
       W: Yes. The problem of smoking, overeating or even taking drugs comes from the same brain chemical.
       <br/>
       M: How can we stop our addiction?
       <br/>
       W: Experts say to find other things that give you pleasure like a hobby or interest in healthy activities.

       <br/>
       M:  You’re the family cook?

       <br/>
       M:  Does she have a difficult job?
       <br/>
       W:  It’s not that. She’s been busy because my little brother broke his left foot last week. She’s had to drive him everywhere like school and music lessons, so she doesn’t have time to cook a proper meal.
       <br/>
       M:  That’s nice of you to help your mum.
       <br/>
       W:  Honestly, that’s not my doing. I’d rather not cook, but my dad insists that I help my mum. I wouldn’t mind helping, but I’m so busy at university and my job at the library.
       <br/>
       M:  That’s a lot of pressure on you, isn’t it?

       M:  Me? Ha-ha. I’m the last person you want to ask. I don’t even know how to properly cook an egg. The last time I tried, I burnt it so badly that my mate thought the kitchen was on fire!
       <br/>
       W:  So you never cook?
       <br/>
       M:  Never! That’s why I asked if you wanted to go to the pub with me.
       <br/>
       W:  That must get expensive to always eat out.
       <br/>
       M:  It does, but what choice do I have?
       <br/>
       W:  Learn to cook! It’s easier than you think.
       <br/>
       M:  Would you mind helping me?
       <br/>
       W:  I’d be glad to help, but you could also learn from watching videos on the Internet. There are also some great cookbooks.
       <br/>
       M:  I suppose so, but I usually learn better if someone can teach me.
       <br/>
       W:  OK, I’ll help when I have time.

       There’s one fruit that can help feed hungry people who live in warm and wet areas in the world. It’s called a breadfruit, but it doesn’t look like bread. It’s a round green fruit with an unsmooth skin on the outside. When it’s ready to eat, the skin looks a little yellow and brown. It doesn’t have much taste, and most people say it’s a lot like a potato.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The breadfruit is a good source of food because one tree can produce around 250 fruits each year. The tree is also easy to take care of. But the biggest reason why breadfruit may be the answer to feeding poor people is the healthy ingredients that this fruit provides.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It may be a fruit, but it has a lot of healthy ingredients like meat, which is important especially in poor countries where people can’t afford meat. The biggest problem may be for the people to accept this fruit as part of their cultural diet.

       When an airplane was on fire and landed at the airport safely, many passengers on the plane were not in a hurry to exit the plane. These people were warned to leave their belongings and just get out. Instead, many of them reached up into the overhead cases and got their bags before they left the plane.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We might react in the same way, but experts say it’s the wrong thing to do. We waste too much time getting our things, and whilst we’re trying to get out of the plane, the bags can block the way to the exit, or people can fall over the bags and injure themselves.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Some experts think airlines should lock these cases, but many people think this would be very unpopular because passengers want to be able to get things out of their bags during the flight.
       <br/>
       <br/>

       Reality television is a genre of television programming which presents dramatic or humorous situations without any pre-written script, documents actual events, and features ordinary people rather than professional actors. It could be described as a form of “heightened” documentary. It covers a wide range of formats, from game or quiz shows to productions which focus on careful observation of the participants. Although the genre has existed in some form or another since the early years of television, the current explosion of popularity just started a decade ago.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Critics comment that the term “reality television” is somewhat of a misnomer. Such programs do not actually present reality as it is, but rather show a modified and highly influenced form of reality. The participants are often put in exotic locations or unusual situations, sometimes coached to act in certain ways by off-screen handlers. The events on screen are also manipulated through editing and other post-production techniques.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Part of reality television’s appeal lies in its ability to place ordinary people in extraordinary situations. For example, on the ABC show, The Bachelor, an eligible man dates a dozen women simultaneously, traveling to beautiful places on various dates. Reality television also has the potential to turn its participants into national celebrities, especially in talent and performance programs such as Pop Idol.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Some critics have said that the name “reality television” is an inaccurate description for several styles of program included in the genre. In competition-based programs such as Big Brother and Survivor, and other special-living-environment shows like The Real World, the producers design the format of the show and control the day-to-day activities and the environment. These types of show create a completely fabricated (虚构的) world in which the competition plays out. Producers specifically select the participants, and use carefully designed scenarios, challenges, events and settings to encourage particular behaviors and conflicts. Mark Burnett, creator of Survivor and other reality shows, agrees with this comment and avoids the word “reality” to describe his shows. He once said, “I tell good stories. It really is not reality TV. It really is unscripted drama.”

       The notion that the great apes, such as chimpanzees and gorillas, can imitate one another might seem unsurprising to anyone who has watched these animals playing at the zoo. But in scientific circles, the question of whether apes really do “
       <u>
        ape
       </u>
       ” has become controversial.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Consider a young chimpanzee watching his mother crack open a cola nut, as has been observed in the Tai Forest of Africa. In most cases, the youth will eventually take up the practice himself. How does he learn this? Is it because he copies it from his mother, or does the skill originate solely from trial and error? If the young animal copies adult behavior, then chimpanzees must have the ability to develop cultural traits, i.e. knowledge or skills passed down from generation to generation, instead of by genetic inheritance. However, if the young learns how to crack the nut exclusively by trial and error, then chimpanzees must, in a sense, reinvent the method each time they deal with a nut, and hence, no real cumulative culture can ever develop.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       The clearest way to establish how chimpanzees learn is through laboratory experiments. A team of scientists at Goldsmith’s College, University of London, used artificial fruits to determine whether chimpanzees imitate or not. In a typical experiment, one group of chimpanzees watched a complex technique for opening a fruit, while a second group observed a very different method. Then the researchers recorded the extent to which the chimpanzees had been influenced by the method they observed. They also conducted similar experiments with three-year-old children as subjects. The results demonstrate that six-year-old chimpanzees show imitative behavior markedly like that seen in the children, although the preciseness of their copying tends to be poorer. In another experiment, chimpanzees copied an entire sequence of actions they had witnessed, but did so only after trying some alternatives. This suggests that they tended to imitate what they had observed others doing at the expense of their own trial-and-error discoveries.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       In the researchers’ view, these findings indicate that apes do ape and that this ability forms one strand in cultural transmission. In other words, learning from elders is crucial to growing up as a competent wild chimpanzee.

       Organic food has more of the antioxidant (抗氧化剂) compounds linked to better health than regular food, according to the most comprehensive scientific analysis to date. The international team behind the work, led by Prof. Carlo Leifert at Newcastle University, concludes that there are “statistically significant, meaningful” differences, with a range of antioxidants being “substantially higher” in organic food. The increased levels of antioxidants are equivalent to “one to two of the five portions of fruits and vegetables recommended to be consumed daily”.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       The findings will bring to the boil a long-simmering (炖) row over whether those differences mean organic food is better for people. Tom Sanders, a professor of nutrition at King’s College London, said, “The question is whether they are within natural variation, and whether they are nutritionally relevant.” According to Sanders, Leifert’s work had caused controversy in the past. He added that the research also showed organic cereals have less protein than conventional crops.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Leifert’s research, released in the
       <i>
        British Journal of Nutrition
       </i>
       , are based on an analysis of 343 peer-reviewed studies from around the world – more than ever before – which examine differences between organic and conventional fruits, vegetables and cereals.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Leifert and his colleagues conclude that many antioxidants have previously been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and certain cancers. But they also note that no long-term studies showing health benefits from a broad organic diet have yet been conducted.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       The research is certain to encounter criticism. The inclusion of so many studies in the analysis could mean poor quality work distorts the results, although the team claimed that excluding weaker work did not significantly change the outcome. The greatest criticism, however, will be over the suggestions of potential health benefits. An earlier analysis, which took in 223 studies in 2012, found little evidence that organic foods are significantly more nutritious than conventional foods.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Sanders said he was not persuaded by the new work. “You are not going to be better nourished if you eat organic food,” he said. “What is most important is what you eat, not whether it’s organic or conventional. It’s whether you eat fruit and vegetables at all.”

       Research suggests that we view our loved ones through rose-tinted glasses that overlook the physical flaws that might put others off. As a result, husbands and wives think their other halves are more attractive than they really are.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       The phenomenon could help explain some apparently physically mismatched couples such as the glamorous Beyonce and Jay-Z, the striking Lara Stone and David Walliams, or the statuesque Sophie Dahl and the diminutive Jamie Cullum.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       The “positive illusion” theory comes from researchers who asked 70 couples to rate their other halves for attractiveness. Questions included how attractive their husband, wife, boyfriend or girlfriend was to the opposite sex, and how they rated compared with others of the same age. The results, reported in The Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, revealed that couples rated the physical appeal of their partners higher than that of strangers.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       The researchers at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands explain this from a psychological perspective. During the course of a romantic relationship, partners will frequently uncover sources of negativity or conflict that may raise the fear that their partner is not the “right” person after all. Such doubts about the partner are troublesome because negativity typically surfaces when the individuals have already invested in their relationship.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       In order to reach some resolution between their hopes and doubts, and sustain a sense of security, partners often weave an elaborate fictitious (虚构的) story that both magnifies a partner’s virtues and minimizes his faults. By means of these positive illusions, partners may enhance their sense of security and stabilize their long-term bond.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Those who participated in the study were relatively young and had been together on average for just two and a half years. The researchers said that more work is needed to see if those in long marriages are still blind to their partner’s physical flaws. They think it is possible that positive illusions are much stronger in the beginning of the relationship when partners are still in love and tend to idealize each other strongly. Likewise, positive illusions may be stronger when people are younger and, as a consequence, relatively attractive.

      《周易》（

      /
      <i>
       Book of Changes
      </i>
      ）是中国最古老的经典著作之一。《周易》的基础是阴阳以及由阴阳组合成的八卦（Eight Trigrams）。《周易》的“易”是“变化”的意思，即世界上的一切都有阴阳两面，阴阳的相互作用形成无所不在的运动态势，所以世界上的一切都处于永恒的变化之中。《周易》在中国历史上的深远影响可能超乎我们的想象。根据它的原理，科学家观察天文地理，医生决定治疗方案，艺术家寻找艺术创作灵感，军事家（military strategists）确定如何用兵。总之，《周易》是一套系统的哲学思想，反映了中国人对宇宙生命的看法。

        (
        <i>
         Book of Changes
        </i>
        ) is one of the oldest Chinese classics. It is based on the combination of yin and yang as well as the Eight Trigrams composed of
        <i>
         yin
        </i>
        and
        <i>
         yang

        . “Yi” in
        <i>
         Zhouyi
        </i>
        means “change”; that is to say, everything in the world has two sides,
        <i>
         yin
        </i>
        and
        <i>
         yang

        , and the interaction of
        <i>
         yin
        </i>
        and
        <i>
         yang
        </i>
        results in the motion existing everywhere, so everything in the world is in constant change. We cannot imagine the profound impact of
        <i>
         Zhouyi
        </i>
        in Chinese history. Based on its principles, scientists study astronomy and geography, doctors decide on medical treatments, artists seek inspiration in artistic creation, and military strategists determine how to use military force. In short,
        <i>
         Zhouyi
        </i>
        is a set of systematic philosophical thoughts, reflecting the Chinese people’s views on life in the universe.
