       Let’s get started with the virus that’s already affected more than 200,000 victims worldwide. But it’s not a biological outbreak that makes people sick, it’s a cyber attack. It started on Friday.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Its spread was temporarily slowed down over the weekend by a cyber security researcher, but the criminals behind the attack found a way to get the virus spreading again. And experts were concerned that Monday morning, when people got back to work, and started up their computers, the number of infected machines would jump.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The problem is caused by a type of software that can damage computer systems. What it’s doing is locking up computers that used Microsoft Windows and asking for payment. If owners pay between $300 and $600, they’ll get access to their machines back.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The thing has spread far and wide. It’s been detected in at least 150 countries. International companies like FedEx and Nissan had been targeted. Russia’s Central Bank was reportedly attacked but wasn’t hurt by the virus. Other governments and businesses were taking steps to either contain or prevent the virus altogether.

       At least 59 people have been killed and another 527 injured in a mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       A gunman, named as 64-year-old Nevada resident Stephen Paddock, opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel towards an open-air music festival attended by 22,000.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       He killed himself as police stormed the room where 10 guns were found. Investigators have found no link to international terrorism, despite a claim from so-called Islamic State.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       In an address from the White House, President Donald Trump described the attack as “pure evil”. He praised the efforts of the emergency services, saying their “miraculous” speed saved lives, and announced he would be visiting Las Vegas on Wednesday. With First Lady Melania by his side, he later observed a moment of silence on the White House lawn.

      <p style="text-align:justify">
       M: Give me a break. I’ve never understood why people get so excited about her. She’s just a talk show host.
      </p>

       W: Just a host? Are you kidding? She’s one of the most heart-felt and influential women of all time. She’s changed the way I eat and exercise! I’ve been getting her magazine since August of 2005. And there’s her book club. Two of my favorite books Oprah recommended are

We fought a "huge" fight because she wanted a $4,000 dress for the school dance. I’d just bought her a $2,500 dress for her birthday party and told her she could only spend $2,000 for the school dance party dress… but maybe I’ll just give her the $4,000 for the school dance dress.

       With online purchases becoming more popular each year, companies need to find ways to reduce their delivery costs. One company has begun testing robots to deliver products to customers in order to save money. One of the founders of Skype thinks his company has a solution to reduce costs by eliminating trucks and drivers. They want to use robots. The robot is like a box with six wheels. It has nine cameras and instruments to help guide it on the sidewalk and avoid hitting people and objects on the sidewalks. The company had to create their own special sidewalk maps for the robots to use because most other maps are street maps.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       When the robot arrives at the delivery destination, it sends a message to the customer’s phone. The customer goes to the robot and pushes a button on the cell phone’s message. This unlocks the lid, so the customer can open it to collect his order.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       People may consider this a bad idea because they believe many robots would probably be stolen. However, the company has tried to make this unlikely to happen. Since there are cameras, if someone tries to steal it, their picture would be taken by the robot. The robots also have GPS so they can be located if they are taken. One of the biggest solutions to the possibility of theft is cost. The company made sure that each robot was not too valuable.  The company claims that the most expensive part of the robot costs just $40, so people may be less motivated to steal it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The robot delivery system may help delivery costs to decrease; however, it’s limited because the current robots are rather small, so only smaller products can be delivered using this method. Currently only a few countries are trying this new system. If it’s successful, it’ll expand to more countries in the future.

      <div style="text-align:justify">
       Buying ice cream from a truck has been part of the lives of American children since the early 1920s. No one is exactly sure when and where the first ice cream truck appeared, but many believe that it began when a New York man named Thomas Carvellos was driving a truck full of ice cream when it got a flat tire. Even though the ice cream was melting, Thomas decided to sell it, and people seemed to prefer this soft quality to the hard, frozen one. An idea was born, and soon trucks of ice cream were driven on the streets.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       However, the ice cream truck drivers needed to get the attention of the customers, so they put bells on their trucks so customers would know they were in the neighbourhood. Soon afterwards, a company began using music to signal to children that an ice cream truck was coming down the street.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       In the late 1950s, a British man opened his own ice cream truck business in England after he visited the US and saw how successful they were. Eventually, he took his business to Australia and New Zealand.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       One thing interesting about all of these ice cream trucks is that they play a specific kind of music. They are usual traditional songs from each culture, and this same kind of music is still used today. They don’t use modern, popular songs; they haven’t changed like music styles have changed. People enjoy hearing these old songs because the songs remind them of their childhood when they used to get ice cream.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       However, in a cold country like Sweden, ice cream truck drivers have begun to send text messages because it’s hard for children to hear the music of the ice cream truck because they’re inside, but people are wondering if this method gives the same motivation to buy ice cream as hearing music.

        Failure Was A Stepping Stone to Success
       </b>
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       A) On a sweltering (闷热的) evening in central London this week, smartly dressed young women gathered to discuss “Redefining Success Beyond Money and Power”. The keynote speaker contrasted the ancient Greek philosophers’ ideal of “a good life” with our modern misunderstanding that it means working 24/7, sleepless and stressed, soldered (焊接) to a BlackBerry. We need a revolution to redefine success, she told her audience. Rest, relaxation and meditation are the future. “Prioritize your health. Live your life as if everything is rigged (装配) in your favor. Burnt-out people do not create a sustainable planet.”
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       B) We meet the following day at the office of The Huffington Post UK, one of eight global offices producing one of the most popular English language news websites on the planet. Created in 2005, the website with an eclectic (博采众长的) mix of original journalism and links to other published articles and blogs by anyone from Barack Obama to a homeless teenager is now read by more than 75 million people every month, and was bought by AOL (American Online) in 2011 for $315 million.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       C) Arianna Huffington has been confounding (混淆) expectations ever since she arrived in London from Greece as a 16-year-old with her mother and sister, saw a photo of Cambridge University and decided to apply. With the exception of her mother, everyone told her she didn’t stand a chance, not least because she could barely speak English. She won a place to study economics, joined the Union, a debating society in Cambridge, got laughed at for her accent and total ignorance of the rules of debating, but was elected its first foreign female president. She was soon appearing on TV panel shows, fell in love with the celebrated
       <i>
        The Times
       </i>
       columnist Bernard Levin and published her first bestseller at 23. By 30 her fourth book had been serialized in
       <i>
        The Sunday Times
       </i>
       for a record-breaking £150,000. But when Levin, twice her age, refused to marry and have children, off she went with her mother and sister to conquer New York.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       D) Soon she was Manhattan’s premiere socialite (社会名流), and before long an oil billionaire’s wife. Relocating to Washington in the 1980s, she became the darling of the Republican right, getting her husband elected to Congress and establishing herself as a glamorous DC power broker. After 11 years and two daughters, the marriage ended amicably after her husband’s announcement that he was bisexual, prompting another move – to California, mother and sister still in tow – where she reinvented herself again as a passionate liberal and society queen. She ran against Arnold Schwarzenegger for state governor in 2003, before drawing on 40 years of high-octane (富有活力的) networking to get her rich and famous friends to fund and write for
       <i>
        The Huffington Post
       </i>
       , which she describes as her “last act” and the realization of her life’s work and dreams. “Everything,” as she puts it happily, “happens for a reason.”
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       E) How has she managed to pull all this off? People who know Huffington cite her charm as the answer – so I ask her to demonstrate. The first clue is a bundle of papers in her hand, which she was skimming as she arrived, and which are her research notes on me. This, I can safely say, has never happened before. She mentions articles I’ve written, and tells me she’s ordered a book I wrote years ago. “I love the title,” she purrs. “I love it. I think I’m going to learn a lot about you.”
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       F) Let’s pretend I were a powerful political player she had just met at a cocktail party, I suggest. What would she say to me? She dissolves into bashful (害羞的) giggles. “For me it is about how good a listener you are, how you listen. Because the worst thing you can do in terms of connecting with people is when you are looking over their shoulder to see if there is someone more interesting in the room. And I think what we all want is to be seen in a real way.”
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       G) She never bothers discussing current affairs. “Few people have really profound thoughts on the news of the day, right? They’re just rehashing (重复) whatever the editorial said. I want to talk to people about themselves and what’s happening in their lives. And I think that’s what people really talk about. I’m much more interested in having real conversations. I would want to talk to you about how you dealt with your mother’s death, or about your book.”
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       H) The real secret seems to be her astonishing resilience (恢复力) in the face of criticism or failure. “I think you have to understand – you have to think of my mother. She was an incredible force in my life because she’d given me this amazing, unconditional love, which was like a treasure trove (收藏品), so whatever else was going on I felt this incredible loving from her. The feeling she brought me and my sister up on was: try, whatever it is; failure is not the opposite of success but a stepping stone to success. So if you stand up at the Cambridge Union and they ridicule you, it doesn’t matter; you’ll stand up again and you’ll learn and get better at it.”
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       I) Her latest big idea is a movement she calls The "Third Metric" and describes as “the third wave of feminism”. “What we’re saying is we need to reshape the world in which women are participating. Not just break through ceilings in the current broken system. We have to get away from the way men have constructed work around war metaphors and sports metaphors and praising each other for working 24/7, working round the clock – these phrases simply encourage a very destructive way to lead our lives, and we are paying a very high price.”
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       J) She cites Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, whose best ideas apparently came after meditating or retreating to a technology-free log cabin. “We must learn to really think and connect with our wisdom, and I really believe we all have that deeper wisdom in us. My point is, it’s not a trade-off: Either you work really hard and are successful, or not. We are seeing that mindfulness and meditation are all also performance-enhancing techniques.”
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       K) Lots of journalists would love to stop working 24/7, but blame websites including
       <i>
        The Huffington Post
       </i>
       for taking their work and giving it away for free. She looks puzzled. “I’m surprised because that’s such a discredited argument. I’m a big believer in aggregation, but we always link back to the creators, so they would have a lot more traffic for their work. Beyond that,
       <i>
        The Huffington Post
       </i>
       has 800 jobs for journalists, editors and engineers, so that argument is really obsolete.” People are happy to talk about their ideas on Newsnight for free, she points out; she’s merely offering them a global platform.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       L) At 63 she is a multimillionaire; her daughters are grown up and she cannot think of a single famous living person she would like to meet but has not. By any definition of success, she has surely reached the point at which she could stop, hasn’t she? “But what else would I be doing? I’d be bored to death lying on a beach in the south of France.”

       Governments throughout the world act on the assumption that the welfare of their people depends largely on the economic strength and wealth of the community. Under modern conditions, this requires varying measures of centralized control and hence the help of specialized scientists such as economists and operational research experts. Furthermore, it is obvious that the strength of country’s economy is directly bound up with the efficiency of its agriculture and industry, and that this in turn rests upon the efforts of scientists and technologists of all kinds. It also means that governments are increasingly compelled to interfere in these sectors in order to step up production and ensure that it is utilized (利用) to the best advantage. For example, they may encourage research in various ways, including the setting up of their own research centers; they may alter the structure of education, or interfere in order to reduce the wastage of natural resources or develop resources hitherto (到目前为止) unexploited; or they may cooperate directly in the growing number of international projects related to scientific and technological manpower of all kinds.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Owing to the remarkable development in mass-communications, people everywhere are feeling new wants and are being exposed to new customs and ideas, while governments are often forced to introduce still further innovations (创新) for the reasons given above. At the same time, the normal rate of social change throughout the world is taking place at a vastly accelerated speed compared with the past. For example, in the early industrialized countries of Europe, the process of industrialization — with all the far-reaching changes in social patterns that followed — was spread over nearly a century, whereas nowadays a developing nation may undergo the same process in a decade or so. All this has the effect of building up unusual pressures and tensions within the community and consequently presents serious problems for the governments concerned. Additional social stresses may also occur because of the population explosion or problems arising from mass migration movements — themselves made relatively easy nowadays by modern means of transport. As a result of all these factors, governments are becoming increasingly dependent on biologists and social scientists for planning the appropriate programs and putting them into effect.

       Why do smokers tend to weigh less than nonsmokers and gain weight when they give up the habit?
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Contrary to “common knowledge”, nonsmokers do not generally eat more than smokers, nor do they exercise less, studies find. Research performed on smokers at rest indicates that nicotine (尼古丁) itself can increase basal metabolic (新陈代谢的) rates, meaning smokers burn more energy than nonsmokers during periods of inactivity. But surveys suggest most smokers smoke not while completely at rest, but while performing light activities such as desk work that can increase metabolic rates by two or three times. Unless nicotine’s metabolic effects increase proportionally with metabolic rates, its influence on weight might be insignificant.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Now a study shows that nicotine’s effects on body-fuel consumption indeed increase proportionally with increases in activity. “These results indicate that the metabolic effect of nicotine may play a greater part in accounting for body-weight differences between smokers and nonsmokers than was previously believed,” says Kenneth A. Perkins and his colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       The researchers gave a nicotine nose spray to individuals performing light work — in this case riding an exercise bicycle modified to allow easy riding while subjects remain seated in a comfortable armchair. The activity raised resting metabolic rates two to three times.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       By analyzing air breathed out, the researchers calculated energy consumption in the armchair bicyclists before and after giving the nose spray and compared the relative changes with subjects in the control group given placebo (（试验药物用的）无效对照剂) nose sprays. Relative to their baseline bicycle expenditures, individuals in the nicotine group expended considerably more energy than did those in control group while doing the same amount of work. With nicotine, Perkins says, “It’s as if the body is becoming much less efficient in using its stored energy.”
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       While the results may seem discouraging to smokers who’d like to quit without gaining weight, Perkins notes that walking an extra mile a day should make up for the difference in metabolic efficiency. And he says smokers would have to gain “well more than 50 pounds” to counterbalance the health risks of continued smoking.
