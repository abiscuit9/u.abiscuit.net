                                    The International Mars Society recently held a four-day conference in the American state of Colorado. During the meeting, the American-based Mars Society announced a competition for university students around the world. The group is urging the students
                                    to help with plans for sending humans to Mars. About six months ago the non-profit Inspiration Mars Foundation proposed sending humans to Mars within five years. Under the plan, a spacecraft would carry a woman and
                                    a man to within 160 kilometers of the red planet. Then, it would return them to the Earth. The crew is expected to be American. But the process of getting to Mars is an international effort.
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/> The president of the Mars Society, Robert Zubrin, made the competition announcement. He has asked that teams of students design a two-person Mars flight operation that could launch in 2018. The designs will be
                                    judged on cost, quality, simplicity and timing. The Mars Society, Inspiration Mars and the American space agency will choose the judges.
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/> The challenge of humans to Mars could inspire a new generation to want to develop their minds to become scientists, engineers, technological entrepreneurs, researchers. The competition is open to university engineering
                                    students worldwide. The teams must be mostly students although some professors, university alumni and others can take part. Competition finalists will present their plans at the space agency’s Ames Research Center in
                                    California.
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/> The Inspiration Mars Foundation is the idea of businessman and space tourist Dennis Tito. Robert Zubrin admits he does not belong to the group. But he says he thinks its idea of a trip to Mars is a realistic possibility.

                                    Beauty has always been regarded as something praise-worthy. Almost everyone thinks attractive people are happier and healthier, have better marriages and have more respectable occupations. Personal consultants give them better advice for finding jobs.
                                    Even judges are softer on attractive defendants. But in the executive circle, beauty can become a dilemma.
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/> While attractiveness is a positive factor for a man on his way up the executive ladder, it is harmful for a woman. Handsome male executives were perceived as having more integrity than plainer men; effort and
                                    ability were thought to account for their success. Attractive female executives were considered to have less integrity than unattractive ones; their success was attributed not to ability but to such factors as luck.
                                    Consequently, attractive female overnight successes were attributed more to personal relationships and less to ability than unattractive overnight successes.
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/> An attractive woman is perceived to be more feminine, and an attractive man more masculine than the less attractive one. Thus, an attractive woman has an advantage in traditionally female jobs, but an attractive
                                    woman in a traditionally masculine position appears to lack the masculine qualities required.
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/> This is true even in politics. Anne Bowman, who recently published a study of the effects of attractiveness of political candidates, asked 125 undergraduate students to rank two groups of photographs, one of men
                                    and one of women in order of attractiveness. The students were told the photographs were of candidates for political offices. They were asked to rank them again, in the order they would vote for them. The results showed
                                    that attractive males utterly defeated unattractive men, but the women who had been rated most attractive always received the fewest votes.

        Women in the Labor Force
       </b>
                                    <br/>
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify">
                                    A) Women are considered labor force participants only if they work outside the home. In the past women were expected to be in the labor force only until they married; this reflected the historical, idealized notion of a society in which the man was the
                                    breadwinner and the woman the homemaker. This notion of the family was not a reality in the past and is not so today, since more than half of all married women work outside the home. But the idea that women belong in
                                    the home has had a significant effect on the conditions under which they participate in the labor force. That participation is characterized by segregation and low pay.
                                    <br/>
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify">
                                    B) The majority of women in the labor force have always been isolated in “female” occupations, called such because they are often extensions of the work women do at home and because the vast majority of the people doing them are women. Some occupations
                                    have changed over time and new ones have come into existence, but various occupations are still defined as women’s work. Today women have one unpaid job in the home and one low-paid job in the labor force. Women have
                                    always been responsible for work in the home and in the labor force they have always been paid lower wages than men. They have been paid less both when their jobs are not the same as those of men but could be seen as
                                    equally valuable and when the work is exactly the same. Women earned 52.8 percent of what men earned in 1911, 58 percent in 1971 and 66 percent in 1996.
                                    <br/>
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify">
                                    C) At the end of the 19th century, factories replaced families as main productive units. Factory work involved long hours, low wages and often brutal working conditions. For example, young girls worked for 60 hours a week for 80 cents, or less than two
                                    cents per hour. In 1901 women comprised 13 percent of the total labor force and the female labor-force participation rate was 14 percent (this refers to women who worked for pay; many women worked but were not paid).
                                    <br/>
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify">
                                    D) The majority of women were employed as servants, dressmakers, teachers, seamstresses (女裁缝师), tailors, housekeepers, launderers, milliners (女帽商) and saleswomen. During the first half of the 20th century, the number of jobs available to women was limited
                                    and strong sentiment existed against married women working outside the home. Men feared that the cheap labor of large numbers of women would undercut their wages; employers and moral reformers were concerned that work
                                    would impair the femininity and high moral standards of women and distract them from their true calling as wives and mothers.
                                    <br/>
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify">
                                    E) During World War I, women replaced men who had joined the armed services, but the labor shortage was not severe enough to warrant their large-scale employment. Although women did men’s jobs, they did not receive men’s wages. By 1921, 65 percent of
                                    all women workers were in clerical, domestic service and professional (mainly teaching and nursing) occupations.

                                    F) In the early part of the 20th century, women’s fight for equality focused on political rights and was characterized by the suffrage (选举权) movement. The right to the federal vote was finally won in 1918, and by 1922 women had won the right to vote in
                                    all provinces except Quebec, where the struggle continued until 1940. In 1929 women were recognized as “persons” eligible to hold a seat in the Canadian Senate.

                                    G) The expansionary period of the 1920s was cut short by the Great Depression, but production and employment expanded enormously with World War II and once again employers hired single and then married women to do men’s jobs, once again for lower wages.
                                    This time, however, many stayed and found employment in the service industries.

                                    H) Greater numbers of women entering the labor force presented male-dominated trade unions with a dilemma. Trade unionists feared the competition from “unskilled” female labor and were concerned as well with maintaining the traditional role of women.
                                    Simultaneously, they were interested in protecting all workers, including women. Women workers, however, with or without the support of the trade-union movement, have traditionally fought for higher wages and better
                                    working conditions.

                                    I) The 1950s was a time of rapid economic expansion. Changes in the productive process, emphasis by government and private industry on construction and on research and development, expansion in health, welfare and educational services, and the need to
                                    advertise, sell and finance new products all created new jobs for women.
                                    <br/>

                                    J) By mid-20th century many families, in order to be able to afford more goods and to educate their children, needed two income earners. Because young people were staying in school longer, married women entered the labor force to help their families raise
                                    their standard of living.

                                    K) Since the 1950s there has been a steady increase in part-time work and by 1994 the number of part-time jobs, which have few benefits and little security, had expanded enormously; 69.4 percent of these were filled by women. Women continued to earn lower
                                    wages than men and in 1980 the average wage rate for full-time women workers was 64 percent of that of the average wage rate for men workers. By 1993 women’s wages had increased somewhat and men’s wages had declined,
                                    narrowing the gap between their earnings to 72 percent. In 1994, 70 percent of women were still employed in clerical, sales, service, teaching and nursing and health-related occupations; women comprised 43 percent of
                                    the total labor force.

                                    L) From 1971 women organized to demand greater equality in wages and working conditions, and to gain recognition of their social, economic, legal and political position in society. The women’s movement of the 1960s had made many women aware of their right
                                    to independence and control of their own lives. Women joined unions and other organizations in greater numbers. The women’s movement also raised and debated issues such as wages for housework, pensions for housewives
                                    and public childcare.
                                    <br/>

                                    M) Considerable agreement existed in a wide range of areas: the prohibition of discrimination in employment policies on the grounds of gender or marital status, affirmative action, equal pay for work of equal value, maternity leave and benefits, adequate
                                    day care facilities, provision for health and safety, and protection against sexual harassment (骚扰) in the workplace. By 1994, 57 percent of mothers with children five years and under were in the labor force and the
                                    crisis in childcare services was a major issue. As the need for the two-income-earner family increases, so does the demand for parental leave and quality daycare programs that recognize women’s role in the labor force
                                    and men’s role in child rearing and household work.

                                    N) Achieving the goal of equality would require major social, political and economic changes in order to create structures such as parental leave and childcare programs that support women and overturn existing structures such as labor-force segregation
                                    and low wages that are disadvantageous to women. It would also require changes in attitudes that divide work in the labor force and work in the home into “women’s” work and “men’s” work.

                                    Many immigrants who settled in the United States were poor. The country they came to was a wilderness. Land had to be cleared of trees in order to make farms; mines had to be developed; houses, shops, and public buildings had to be built. Everyone endeavored
                                    to earn their livelihood. Manual labor was highly valued. Thereafter it was the man who worked with his head to achieve success in business and industry who was esteemed. Now there is in America a curious combination
                                    of pride in having risen to a position where it is no longer necessary to depend on manual labor for a living and genuine delight in what one is able to accomplish with one’s own hands.

                                    The attitude toward manual labor is seen in an array of things in American life. One is invited to dinner at the home of a middle-aged couple. It is not only comfortable but extravagantly furnished together with beautifully landscaped gardens; yet the
                                    hostess probably will cook and serve the dinner. Additionally, she is prone to do much of the housework, and even though the husband may be a professional man, he talks about washing the car, digging in the flowerbeds,
                                    or painting the house. He often assists her in washing dishes and doing other household chores (杂务) aptly. The son or daughter who is away at college may get a summer job involving manual labor to earn next year’s school
                                    expense.

                                    It has been an American ideal to rise from a humble beginning to a better position. Therefore the “servant class” has not remained a fixed group. In fact, it has almost ceased to exist because people, who in earlier days might have been servants, now
                                    get higher wages working in factories. The majority of families cannot afford to pay what people who do housework or gardening charge for their services.

                                    The expense of household service and of skilled labor, such as painting and carpentry, and the tradition of working with one’s hands have contributed to keeping alive the spirit of “do-it-yourself”. Many articles in popular magazines are developed to
                                    instruction in gardening, carpentry, and interior decorating. The average American gets a good deal of pleasure out of telling others about his or her projects, exhibiting them for their neighbors, or taking them to
                                    the country fair, where they will surely win a prize.
