       W: Mr. Kiffler, here in Human Resources, we’ve received complaints about your working style. Many older employees feel your behavior is rushed, disrespectful and rude.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       M: What? Are you serious? That’s so unfair! I work so hard to make up for all the time they’ve wasted! And they are calling me rude? Wow!!

       W: “All – the – time – they – waste?”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       M: Yes! Example: I email Mr. Clarkson a simple question BUT instead of emailing me back, he comes by my office to talk about it. Everything takes soooooooooo long!
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       W: I’m hearing a lot these days about cultural shifts in timing and pacing – so much faster for the younger generation – causing big problems…
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       M: Cultural shifts? Excuse me Ms. Palmer. The older generation is too slow, too lazy for the new technology. Basically, I think they don’t want to learn or change!
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       W: Mr. Kiffler, that’s the attitude I’m talking about. Things are never as simple as they seem. It’s true that older people often resist change, staying with what they know and trust. Technology can be challenging and difficult.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       M: Like how Mr. Marshal keeps asking me to fix basic computer problems he could easily fix himself with five minutes of trial and error?

      <p style="text-align:justify">
       W: Mr. Kiffler, I want you to slow down and listen. You’re a good employee and we value your work. You’ve been here for nine months. Many of those people have been here for 20-30 years.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       M: That’s no excuse!
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       W: No! Wait. This isn’t about excuses. This is about communication styles and respect. You have to slow down and take time to get to know and show respect to your co-workers who are older. You both have a lot to learn from each other.

       Seat belts protect drivers and passengers in case of accident. They also reduce the effect of a crash on the body. Safety experts estimate that the restraining devices save more than four thousand lives a year in the United States alone.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The first seat belt was said to have been created in the 1800s by George Cayley of England. He is remembered for many inventions, especially for early “flying machines.”
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The United States first recognized the invention of an automobile seat belt in 1849. The government gave a patent to Edward J. Claghorn of New York City so that others would not copy his invention. Claghorn called the device a Safety-Belt.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But more than one hundred years passed before the current, widely used seat belt was developed. It resulted from the work of a Swedish engineer, Nils Bohlin. His three-point, lap and shoulder seat belt first appeared on cars in Europe fifty years ago.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       After completing college, Bohlin designed seats for the Swedish aircraft industry. The seats were built for the pilot to escape from an airplane in case of disaster. Bohlin’s work with planes showed him what could happen in a crash at high speed. In 1958, Bohlin brought that knowledge to the Swedish car manufacturer Volvo. He was the company’s first chief safety engineer.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       At the time, most safety belts in cars crossed the body over the stomach. A buckle held the restraints in place. But the position of the buckle often caused severe injuries in bad crashes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Nils Bohlin recognized that both the upper and lower body needed to be held securely in place. His invention contained a cloth strap that was placed across the chest and another strap across the hips. The design joined the straps next to the hip.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Volvo was the first automobile manufacturer to offer the modern seat belt as a pumanent addition to its cars. It also provided use of Nils Bohlin’s design to other car-makers.

       A leading group of American doctors is warning against forcing young people to become skilled in a single sport. It says young people who play just one sport face additional physical or other demands from intense training and competition. It says children involved in sports should be urged to take part in different activities and develop many skills.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The group notes that more and more children are skilled in one sport at an early age. Some of the most famous athletes first became active in a sport when they were five years old. A few started even earlier. The group notes that the successes of young athletes can be a powerful example for others to follow. It says children wishing to compete at a high level require training that could be considered extreme even for adults. It says the necessary desire and intensity of training raise many concerns about the safety of high-level athletic activity for any young person.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The group says the health effects of intense training in young athletes need to be fully investigated. Risks to young athletes include injuries, eating disorders and emotional stress.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The group offers some suggestions. It urges children to become involved in sports at levels that meet their abilities and interests. It says doctors should work with parents to make sure that someone knowledgeable is training the child athlete. That person should know correct methods of training, equipment and the physical and emotional health of young competitors.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The group says doctors should supervise the condition of child athletes involved in intense training. It says doctors and trainers should work to prevent injuries that result from too much physical activity. Doctors should make sure the children eat a healthy, balanced diet. And doctors should watch for signs of too much training, including weight loss and sleep problems.

        What can we do to help the children of broken families?
       </b>
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       A) There they were, two sweet little girls, six or seven years old, talking frankly to a room packed with adult strangers about the sadness at the heart of their emotional lives. “Our dads both left us when we were babies,” one tot offered dully, “and I didn’t have anyone to talk about that before.” “We’d be friends anyway,” the other started to say. “But we’re special friends because we both know what it’s like.”
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       B) The children were taking part in a presentation at their primary school, put together by Benita Refson, chief executive of the counseling charity “The Place 2 Be”. The aim of the exercise was not only to demonstrate to interested educationalists the advantages of providing a mental-health service in their primary schools, but also to persuade businesses to invest in the program.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       C) Those enlisted to offer their observations and experience – mainly staff from some of the 120 or so primary schools that now host The Place 2 Be teams – were keen to emphasize the range and the seriousness of some of the psychological difficulties faced by the small children in their care. They spoke of children who had witnessed or experienced domestic violence, who had undergone the pain of losing parents or relatives that they could not cope with, who turned up at school in dirty, tattered clothes, or with what were euphemistically (委婉地) described as “food issues”. But again and again, anxieties about separated parents came up, with tiny children full of worry and grief about a severed relationship with a parent who was not at home.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       D) The counselors who worked with such children, however, were overwhelmingly positive about the interventions they were able to make in the lives of children through the employment of one-to-one and group therapy plus a lunchtime drop-in service. In-school counselors can work at piecing together a child’s problems through play therapy, then, if appropriate, lead interventions that inform parents about the emotions their children were expressing in the safety of the therapeutic relationships nurtured at their schools. They report that many parents have found the testimony of their children to be a revelation.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       E) For all sorts of reasons, parents had simply chosen to minimize the impact that the breakup of a family had had on their children. Sometimes, separated parents were able to respond by putting their own differences aside and working much harder at maintaining neutral, regular contact for the sake of the children. Even if that was not possible, an awareness of how their children really felt tended to prompt parents to offer greater emotional support, and to modify any behavior of their own that was increasing their children’s anguish or stress.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       F) At school, such changes transformed the abilities of children, both socially and academically. The Place 2 Be has been independently audited, and the evidence is that schools offering the service have less classroom disruption, better grades, higher attendance rates and fewer exclusions. These, in turn, have a positive impact on staff morale and retention.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       G) This week, 20 years on from the 1989 Children Act, the family law department of law firm Mishcon de Reya published a survey of 4,000 parents and children. It found that one in three children whose parents had separated or divorced had permanently lost contact with their father. One in ten of those said the bitter process had left them feeling suicidal, a third said they had later found comfort in drink and drugs, while 10 percent admitted to involvement in crime. The survey repeated a widely held belief – these poor outcomes were due to failures in the family court system, rather than failures in parenting.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       H) There is not much new there. Campaigning groups and individuals have for many years been expressing anger at the seeming inability of the family courts to intervene successfully in parental disputes. Much of the animus (敌意) against the family courts is directed at their “secrecy”. Yet if you speak to pretty much anyone involved in the day-to-day workings of the courts, they will talk of their disappointment that in the period since journalists were allowed access to the courts, seats set aside for the media have generally remained empty.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       I) This is a shame, because attendance at these hearings is instructive. They tend to reveal a group of potentially helpful and deeply frustrated professionals confronted by aggressive and uncooperative parents who are there precisely because they are extremely hostile to each other. Often, as the legal process crawls on, parental frustration and resentment expands, to be directed not only at their former partner but also at the courts, which have done so little to end their private and personal wars. There are constant complaints of court orders ignored or flouted, and expressions of contempt that the courts seem unable to enforce their rulings.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       J) Yet these parents end up in court exactly because they cannot and will not agree. What each tends to want from a hearing is vindication (辩护) of their own behavior or viewpoint. What each tends to leave with is an even greater fury and an ever greater sense of victimhood, fuelled by the irritating fact that the court has remained resolutely neutral.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       K) What can the family courts really do, when they are asked to sort out parental disputes? The need is for compromise, setting aside of adult resentments. But the adversaries (对手) seek “justice” for themselves, and an official adjudication (判决) that entirely backs the desires of one parent and completely rejects those of the other. Hopeless.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       L) The family courts do not become involved in parenting disputes at the prompting of the child, even though, formally, the courts are obliged to make the needs of the child the foremost thing. The great advantage of the sort of psychological interventions The Place 2 Be offers is that they are genuinely led by children. A child’s own point of view can then be put to parents in a non-adversarial setting.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       M) The family courts, of course, commission psychological assessments of children. But the children tend to know that assessments will be used as part of the legal dispute their parents are locked in. Their awareness that they are involved in that adversarial process inhibits their ability to acknowledge, let alone speak about their own feelings.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       N) The amount of time, energy and money that is spent on staging elaborate and formalized angry quarrels between hostile parents is enormous. The cost of placing psychological access in schools is modest by comparison, and also picks up all sorts of other difficulties that children may be facing. Much emphasis is already placed on the usefulness of mediation over court action in family disputes. It’s time to adopt a more subtle system that is truly child-centered, instead.

       Cyber (网络的) bullies, like any bully, want to feel power and control over their victim. Many kids live and breathe on the Internet. It is essential to how they see themselves and how they socialize with their peers. The computer is as essential a social tool today as the telephone was decades ago.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       This is part of why a cyber bullying attack can be disastrous. Targets are faced with threats and intimidation in emails and instant messages, but it is not only fear that the cyber bully can instill (灌输) over the web.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       The potential for public humiliation (羞辱) has been expanded from a target’s classmates or school to effectively the entire world, or at least the wired world. To be humiliated in front of a classroom of students is bad enough but to be humiliated for the amusement of thousands is more than most kids can bear.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       So, as parents, what should you do to deal with cyber bullying?
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       First, do not respond to the cyber bully’s attacks. This is what the bully wants. They want you to engage with them. They want to manipulate you into responding. If you respond in any way that is emotional or lets them know that they are getting to you and are able to make you upset it only encourages the cyber bully.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Second, report the cyber bullying to police and schools. You need to let appropriate authorities know about the cyber bullying or they cannot take corrective action. Cyber bullying is not something you want to ignore. It is your responsibility to report this behavior so the perpetrators (作恶者) can be dealt with. This helps to not only protect your child but to intervene before the cyber bully harms even more kids.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Finally, be aware of what your child is doing on the Internet. It is vital to keep up with what is going on in your child’s world. More and more a large part of that world involves online activities and communication. You need to talk with them about what they are doing and with whom they are communicating.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Cyber bullying can be every bit as dangerous as bullying; more so in some cases. Keep open communication lines with your children so they will feel comfortable enough to tell you. They need to know that cyber bullying is not their fault. The fault and the problem both lay with the cyber bully.
