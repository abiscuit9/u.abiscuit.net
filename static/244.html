      </p>

       The family in Britain is changing. The once typical British family headed by two parents has undergone substantial changes during the twentieth century. In particular there has been a rise in the number of single-person households, which increased from 18 to 29 percent of all households between 1971 and 2002. By the year 2020, it is estimated that there will be more single people than married people. Fifty years ago this would have been socially unacceptable in Britain.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       In the past, people got married and stayed married. Divorce was very difficult, expensive and took a long time. Today, people’s views on marriage are changing. Many couples, mostly in their twenties or thirties, live together without getting married. Only about 60 percent of these couples will eventually get married.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       In the past, people married before they had children, but now about 40 percent of children in Britain are born to unmarried parents. In 2000, around a quarter of unmarried people between the ages of 16 and 59 was living together in Great Britain. Before 1960 this was very rare. People are generally getting married at a later age now and many women do not want to have children immediately. They prefer to concentrate on their jobs and put off having babies until their late thirties. The number of single-parent families is increasing. This is mainly due to more marriages ending in divorce, but some women are also choosing to have children as a single parent without being married.

       It’s an ordinary day. You may be entirely relaxed, settling down to watch some TV. Suddenly you begin to feel scared. Everything around you is becoming unreal. Your heart is racing, your head spinning, your hands shaking. An overwhelming sense of despair and pain hits you like a wave. What on earth is going on?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       If you have ever had an experience like this, it’s possible that you were having a “panic attack”. Some people experience panic attacks in tense situations, such as before giving a speech. For others it comes completely unexpectedly. But a panic attack is a very real condition, and not at all the same thing as just getting upset and confused. So what causes it?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Panic attacks begin in the oldest parts of our brain. Before we had evolved rational thought, we still needed to be able to survive in the world. The ability to either fight or flee from a dangerous situation is perhaps the most basic behavior required of any animal.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Panic attacks occur when the body systems responsible for dealing with dangerous situations kick in at the wrong time. There is no danger in relaxing on your couch, and no real danger in giving a speech. But in some people, the “fight or flight” responses can be provoked accidentally. Heart rate increases, breathing becomes shallow, and adrenaline shoots to your arms. These are useful responses to have, if you really are in danger. For people who experience a panic attack, though, they can be both confusing and terrifying.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Several different therapies now exist for panic attacks, ranging from a set of anti-anxiety medicines to behavior modification. So take heart—there’s no need to panic.

        Ludwig van Beethoven
       </b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       <br/>
       A) Ludwig van Beethoven was a German composer of classical music, who lived predominantly in Vienna, Austria. Beethoven is widely regarded as one of history’s supreme composers who produced notable works even after he completely lost his hearing. He was one of the greatest figures in the transitional period between the Classical and Romantic eras in music. His reputation has inspired and in many cases intimidated (吓倒) composers, musicians, and audiences coming after him.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       B) Beethoven’s first music teacher was his father, a musician at Bonn and an alcoholic who beat him and unsuccessfully attempted to exploit him as a child prodigy (天才) like Mozart. His mother died when he was 17, and for several years he was responsible for raising his two younger brothers. Beethoven moved to Vienna in 1792, where he intended to study with Joseph Haydn. He quickly established a reputation as an excellent pianist, and more slowly, as a composer. He settled into the career pattern he would follow for the remainder of his life.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       C) Beethoven’s career as a composer is usually divided into early, middle, and late periods. In the early period, he is seen as emulating (模仿) his great predecessors Haydn and Mozart, at the same time exploring new directions and gradually expanding the scope and ambition of his work. The middle period began shortly after Beethoven’s personal crisis centering around deafness. The period is noted for large-scale works expressing heroism and struggle; these include many of the most famous works of classical music. Beethoven’s late period began around 1816 and lasted until he died in 1827. His works in the late period are greatly admired for and characterized by their intellectual depth, intense and highly personal expression, and his experimentation with different forms.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       D) Beethoven’s personal life was troubled. Around age 26, he started to lose his hearing, which led him to contemplate suicide. He was attracted to unattainable women, whom he idealized. Some scholars believe his period of low productivity was caused by the depression resulting from Beethoven’s realization that he would never marry.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       E) Beethoven quarreled often bitterly with his relatives and others; he frequently treated other people badly. He moved often and had strange personal habits, such as wearing filthy (肮脏的) clothing even as he washed compulsively (强迫地). He often had financial troubles. Many listeners perceive an echo of Beethoven’s life in his music, which often depicts struggle followed by triumph. This description is often applied to Beethoven’s creation of masterpieces in the face of his severe personal difficulties.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       F) Beethoven was often in poor health, especially after his mid-20s, when he began to suffer from serious stomach pains. In 1826 his health took a drastic turn for the worse. His death the following year was attributed to a liver disease, but modern research on a lock of Beethoven’s hair taken at the time of his death, and a few pieces of his skull show that lead poisoning could well have contributed to his ill-health and ultimately to his death. The source of the lead poisoning may have been fish from the heavily polluted Danube River and lead compounds used to sweeten wines. It is unlikely that lead poisoning is the cause of his deafness, which several researchers think is caused by an autoimmune disorder. The hair analysis did not detect mercury (水银), which was consistent with the view that Beethoven did not have syphilis (梅毒), the disease that was commonly treated with mercury compounds at the time.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       G) Beethoven is viewed as one of the most important transitional figures between the Classical and Romantic eras of musical history. As far as musical form is concerned, he built on the principles of sonata form and development that he had inherited from Haydn and Mozart, but greatly extended them, writing longer and more ambitious movements.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       H) But Beethoven also radically redefined the symphony, transforming it from the rigidly structured four-ordered-movements form of Haydn’s era to a fairly open-ended form that could sustain as many movements as necessary, and of whatever form as necessary to give the work cohesion.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       I) Beethoven was much taken by the ideals of the Enlightenment and by the growing Romanticism in Europe. He initially dedicated his Third Symphony to Napoleon in the belief that the general would sustain the democratic and republican ideals of the French Revolution, but in 1804 he tore out the title page upon which he had written a dedication and renamed the symphony, as Napoleon’s imperial ambitions became clear.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       J) Continuing controversy surrounding Beethoven is whether he was a Romantic or a Classical composer. As documented elsewhere, since the meanings of the word “Romantic” and the definition of the period “Romanticism” both vary by discipline, Beethoven’s inclusion as a member of that movement or period must be looked at in context. If we consider the Romantic Movement as an aesthetic epoch in literature and the arts generally, Beethoven sits squarely in the first half along with literary Romantics such as the German poet Goethe and the English poet Percy Shelley. He was also called a Romantic by contemporaries such as E.T.A. Hoffmann. He is often considered the composer of the first song cycle and was influenced by Romantic folk idioms. He set dozens of such poems for voice, piano, and violin. If on the other hand we consider the context of musicology, where Romantic music is dated later, the matter is one of considerably greater debate. For some experts, Beethoven is not a Romantic, and his being one is a myth; for others he stands as a transitional figure, or an immediate precursor (先驱) to Romanticism, the inventor of the Romantic period; for others he is the prototypical Romantic composer, complete with myth of heroic genius and individuality.

       K) The marker buoy(浮标) of Romanticism has been pushed back and forth several times by scholars, and it remains a subject of intense debate, in no small part because Beethoven is seen as a pioneering figure. To those for whom the Enlightenment represents the basis of Modernity, he must therefore be a Classicist, while for those who see the romantic sensibility as a key to later aesthetics, he must be a Romantic.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       L) Listening to Beethoven’s music yields another possible scholarly analysis: There is definitely an evolution in style from Beethoven’s earliest compositions to his later works. The young Beethoven can be seen toiling to conform to the aesthetic models of his contemporaries: He wants to write music that is acceptable in the society of his days. Later, there is much more iconoclasm (打破旧习) in his approach where a symphony had until then only been a purely instrumental genre (类型). This means the question changes from “Whether Beethoven was a Classicist or a Romantic?” to “When was the pivotal moment that Beethoven tilted from dominant Classicism to dominant Romanticism?” Most scholars seem to concur: The presentation of the Fifth and Sixth Symphonies in a single concert in 1808 is probably closest to that pivotal point.

       A generation after Americans lost the habit of knowing who their space heroes really are, the Columbia astronauts were remembered Tuesday as awe-struck (肃然起敬的) youngsters who longed to “reach the stars”, and as fun-loving but dedicated adults who never lost their sense of adventure. President Bush and first lady Laura Bush attended a 45-minute memorial ceremony at the Johnson Space Center.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       The president and the chief of the astronaut corps helped bring the adventurous lives of the seven Columbia astronauts who died Saturday into focus for NASA employees and the nation. Navy Capt. Kent Rominger, the astronaut corps chief, remembered the crew as a ''generous and caring bunch with a great sense of humor''.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Bush also eulogized each astronaut. He spoke on a breezy, clear day as thousands of space program workers stood around a tree-lined pond. The televised ceremony was also broadcast for workers at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. ''Their mission was almost complete, and we lost them so close to home,'' Bush said. ''Their loss was sudden and terrible. And for their families, the grief is heavy. Our nation shares in your sorrow and your pride. And today we remember not only one moment of tragedy but seven lives of great purpose and achievement.'' Bush declared that the United States would continue its manned space program: ''This cause of exploration and discovery is not an option we choose. It is a desire written in the human heart.''
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Bush was accompanied to Houston on Air Force One with former senator John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth, and Neil Armstrong, the first man to set foot on the moon. The president arrived at the ceremony walking hand-in-hand with the first lady. Afterward, they met privately with about 40 family members. A White House assistant said Bush spoke to each person. He made small talk with the children about school and offered his regrets for meeting at such a tragic time. He told one widow, ‘‘you're a strong soul.'' He said to one father who lost a child, ‘‘we're so proud of you as a father. ''
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       The roar of NASA T-38 training jets that flew a ''missing man'' formation still echoed in the distance, as space agency workers leaving the ceremony said they had found comfort in the service.
