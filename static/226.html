      <div style="text-align:justify">
       In countries destroyed by continuous war, brave doctors have stayed in the middle of dangerous areas to help the wounded. To get to the hospital, doctors must drive on unsafe roads because of guns and bombs. Once they arrive, they often care for the wounded whilst there is fighting outside. Sometimes, there are bombs and bullets that hit the hospital, so they have to try to protect the hospital building and patients.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Often, many badly injured patients arrive all at the same time when there is a lot of fighting. Sometimes there aren’t enough beds and the patients must be placed on the floor.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       In addition, doctors often have to manage with no medicine and very little medical equipment. There are also not enough doctors to help everyone, so sometimes doctors have to make a painful choice and pick which patient they help. For example, they may have to stop trying to save a dying child, so they can save somebody who has a good chance to live.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Whilst the doctors are caring for war victims, they are also taking care of patients with regular problems. But these clinics are only at night because it’s too dangerous for patients to walk there in the day.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Doctors are having trouble handling such terrible conditions. They have fears that they may be killed or injured, and they are very tired. There aren’t very many doctors, so most of them must work 20 hours in one day. They also suffer emotionally. They cannot forget seeing the terrible conditions of children in the hospital.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Why do these amazing doctors continue to help these patients? They believe that the world has forgotten these people, and they feel a responsibility to help them. They are heroes for their passion for helping people in a very dangerous place.

       There are a lot of unique buildings in the country of Dubai, and the tallest building in the world is located there. Now, Dubai has another very interesting style of building. Instead of reaching up to the sky, this new place is going down into the ocean.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Most people who are on holiday in Dubai stay at a hotel. Usually the hotel is on land, but a new project is building cottages that are partly under water. Each cottage has three levels, and the bottom level is completely beneath the sea. This bottom level has huge windows, which make it seem like you are standing in the middle of the sea.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The architects had to be careful about the windows because they couldn’t use glass. The pressure under the water is too high and the glass would break. So they had to use a special type of plastic that is used in the sea. They also had to be careful about the furniture in the cottages because the salt in the water and the temperature can damage most materials.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       People may think that the cottage would be like a boat, and that it would move with the water. These people believe that guests in the cottage would feel sick if the sea is rough during bad weather. However, each cottage is connected to the bottom of the sea, and the architects designed the cottage to reduce movement.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It’s interesting that the chairman of the company that designed these cottages is afraid of the ocean, but he said that he was always very interested in what’s under the water. The architects say that the underwater rooms are brilliant. Each day the guests can see different fish and sea creatures swimming right outside their windows. It’s like waking up to a new world every morning.

       M:  Hello?

       W:  Jim? It’s Sharon.

       M:  Hi, Sharon. How are you?
       <br/>
       W:  I’m great, and you?
       <br/>
       M:  I’m doing fine. I was really busy for a while, but now it’s much better.
       <br/>
       W:  That’s good to hear. I have some free time tonight. I was wondering if you’d like to see a movie with me.
       <br/>
       M:  Sounds fun! What movie do you have in mind?
       <br/>
       W:  Well, I’m not sure actually. There are so many different movies in the theaters now that it’s hard to decide. Is there a specific movie you’d like to see?
       <br/>
       M:  Hmm. Nothing specific, but something with a lot of action would be good.
       <br/>
       W:  How about the movie
       <i>
        My Greatest Love
       </i>
       ? It doesn’t have action, but I heard it’s a good movie.
       <br/>
       M:  Is that a romantic movie?
       <br/>
       W:  Yes, it’s about two high school lovers who move far away and find each other after 30 years.
       <br/>
       M:  I don’t like romantic movies. Too much emotion, and it’s boring because nothing ever happens.
       <br/>
       W:  A movie doesn’t have to be about running and shooting. It can be about relationships.
       <br/>
       M:  I realize that, but I’m sorry. I just have no interest in those movies. They make me fall asleep.
       <br/>
       W:  Why do you like those action movies so much? There’s no story, just a lot of action.
       <br/>
       M:  I enjoy watching a group of strong men and women doing amazing things.
       <br/>
       W:  But that’s not real. They’re really not doing those things.
       <br/>
       M:  I know that, but I like to imagine how I could be like them.
       <br/>
       W:  You want to be like a brave hero?
       <br/>
       M:  Sure. Most guys don’t dream about being in love. We would much rather be a hero.
       <br/>
       W:  OK, well, what about scary movies? Do you like those?
       <br/>
       M:  Are you kidding? If I see a scary movie, I will have nightmares for at least a week!

       M:  I’m going to get something to eat at the pub. Care to join me?
       <br/>
       W:  I’d love to, but I’ve got to make dinner for my family.
       <br/>
       M:  You’re the family cook?
       <br/>
       W:  Well, sometimes. My mum usually makes dinner, but she’s been quite busy these few days.
       <br/>
       M:  Does she have a difficult job?
       <br/>
       W:  It’s not that. She’s been busy because my little brother broke his left foot last week. She’s had to drive him everywhere like school and music lessons, so she doesn’t have time to cook a proper meal.
       <br/>
       M:  That’s nice of you to help your mum.
       <br/>
       W:  Honestly, that’s not my doing. I’d rather not cook, but my dad insists that I help my mum. I wouldn’t mind helping, but I’m so busy at university and my job at the library.
       <br/>
       M:  That’s a lot of pressure on you, isn’t it?
       <br/>
       W:  It is, but I can manage since it’s only for a short while. My little brother’s foot should be fine in about four weeks.
       <br/>
       M:  So what’s for dinner tonight?
       <br/>
       W:  Not sure. But certainly something easy. Got any suggestions?
       <br/>
       M:  Me? Ha-ha. I’m the last person you want to ask. I don’t even know how to properly cook an egg. The last time I tried, I burnt it so badly that my mate thought the kitchen was on fire!
       <br/>
       W:  So you never cook?
       <br/>
       M:  Never! That’s why I asked if you wanted to go to the pub with me.
       <br/>
       W:  That must get expensive to always eat out.
       <br/>
       M:  It does, but what choice do I have?
       <br/>
       W:  Learn to cook! It’s easier than you think.
       <br/>
       M:  Would you mind helping me?
       <br/>
       W:  I’d be glad to help, but you could also learn from watching videos on the Internet. There are also some great cookbooks.
       <br/>
       M:  I suppose so, but I usually learn better if someone can teach me.
       <br/>
       W:  OK, I’ll help when I have time.

       The typical workplace is changing. It’s no longer a large building with boring rooms.  Many technology companies are creating unique workplaces for their workers. Some companies have music, game rooms and gyms so workers can relax or exercise.  Some companies even have a slide that workers can use instead of taking the stairs or an elevator. It may seem like people wouldn’t want to work with all of these activities that are available. However, most workers understand that they’re lucky to work in a place like that, so they’re careful to be responsible and productive.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Many companies also offer workers free food all day long and usually have a real kitchen for them to use. Workers can bring their pets to work at some companies too.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       People may wonder why companies would have this type of relaxing environment.  These companies believe that making workplace fun and interesting leads to more creativity and exchange of ideas.

      <div style="text-align: justify;">
       One day in early July, a huge dead whale was found on a California beach. It caused many problems because the smell was bad, and it was unhealthy for the people at the beach. Officials put a rope around the dead whale and used two boats to pull it into the ocean. At first, the whale was too heavy, so the rope broke. They tried again later and were successful.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       However, this was not the last time the whale returned to a California beach. In the next two weeks, the same dead whale came back to a different beach. Each time boats pulled the whale back into the ocean, it came back due to the ocean tides. Finally, after taking the whale back to the ocean six times, the officials decided they must do something different. They decided they must cut the body of the dead whale and bury the pieces.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Biologists aren’t sure why the whale died, but they believe it was old and died naturally.

       Swimming is Yusra Mardini’s passion. Yusra was born in Syria, a country in the Middle East. As a child, she trained to be a swimmer until war came to her country. She couldn’t swim anymore and had to leave her country. With her sister, Yusra left Syria and headed towards Germany.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       On the way, they crossed the Mediterranean Sea. Whilst they were crossing the sea, the boat motor broke, and a lot of water was coming in the boat. Yusra, her sister, and another young woman got out of the boat and began swimming. They were holding onto a rope and pulling the boat to the shore. They swam for over three and a half hours to save the people on the boat.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       After Yusra arrived in Germany, she began to swim again. She was chosen to swim in the 2016 Rio Olympics. The Olympic committee wanted to give hope to all the people who were forced to leave their own countries.

       Many countries want to protect their ancient historical monuments from people who don’t respect them. One of the greatest and most recognizable ancient monuments in the world is the Great Wall in China. Unfortunately, people are damaging the wall. They are stealing the bricks of the wall to build their own walls, and some are even selling them to tourists.  People are now more worried because there was a recent video of a man who was kicking and breaking the bricks of the wall.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The Chinese government doesn’t want more people to damage this important piece of their history, so they’ll try to protect and check the wall more regularly. There’s also a phone number so people can call to report any damage they see. The government realizes that it’s difficult to protect this wall because it’s over 21,000 kilometers long, but they wish to protect this heritage as much as possible.

       Like many of her colleagues, Dr. Rosalind S. Dorlen, a clinical psychologist in Summit, N.J., has no openings for new patients. Though she’s always had a busy practice, the past few months have brought an intensity she’s never before witnessed.

       “Every person coming into my office is talking about this global roller coaster (过山车) we’re on,” says Dorlen, who counsels many Wall Street employees. “There’s widespread anxiety, which I haven’t seen around economic factors in my 30 years of practice.”

       Indeed, the news has been grim. Since the beginning of the year, the economy has shed jobs continuously for nine months, eliminating 760,000 positions. In September, one in 475 housing units received a notice of mortgage default, according to Realty Trac, a firm in Irvine, Calif. And pensions lost roughly $1 trillion from the second quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2008, according to a recent analysis by the Congressional Budget Office.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       What’s next? Nobody knows, but the constant bad news is taking its toll. The American Psychological Association (APA) conducted two online surveys of more than 2,500 people this year and found that respondents’ stress levels rose drastically in September. In April, 66 percent said that the economy was a source of stress. In September, that number jumped to 80 percent.
       <br/>

      <p style="text-align:justify">
       While stress is a normal response in turbulent times, some health professionals are concerned that the financial crisis will hinder the coping abilities of those affected most.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       People who may be prone to anxiety, depression or substance abuse are calling in distress. The firm also has contacted local law enforcement and hospitals about suicide threats once or twice a week as opposed to the average during normal times, which is once a month.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Substance abuse or suicidal thoughts are dramatic red flags, but there are many other warning signs of depression that should be taken seriously. In the APA survey, respondents reported both physical and mental symptoms of stress, including fatigue, muscle tension, lack of interest or motivation, dizziness, headaches, upset stomach, increased irritability or anger, teeth grinding and nervousness.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Taken alone, these symptoms might seem like isolated problems. But when they affect someone dealing with layoffs, mortgage default or other forms of financial stress, they can point to a more troubling struggle with anxiety or depression.

       We are in for more turbulence. The consequences are clearly spreading from Wall Street to Main Street. The recent performance of nonfinancial stocks indicates that investors are well aware of the fact.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       The Fed (美国联邦储备局) now, like the Fed in the 1930s, is very much groping in the dark. Every financial crisis is different, and this one is no exception. It is hard to avoid concluding that the Fed made a big mistake when deciding that Lehman Bros. could safely be allowed to fail. It did not adequately understand the possible consequences for other institutions of allowing a primary dealer to go bankrupt. It failed to understand that its own actions were bringing us to the brink of a destructive financial battle.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       If there is a defense, it has been offered by Rick Mishkin, the former Fed governor, who has asserted that the current shock to the financial system is even more complex than that of the Great Depression. Absorbing the shock is more difficult this time because it is internal to the financial system. Central to the problem are excessive power, lack of transparency, and risk taking in the financial sector itself. There has been a housing-market collapse, but in contrast to the 1930s there has been no general collapse of prices and economic activity. Corporate defaults have remained relatively low, which has been a much-needed source of comfort to the financial system. But this also makes resolving the problem more difficult. Since there has been no collapse of prices and economic activity, we are not now going to be able to grow or inflate our way out of the crisis, as we did after 1933.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       This time the Fed will provide however much liquidity (流动资金) the economy needs. There will be no tax increases designed to balance the budget against the economic slump.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       And what the contraction (收缩) of the financial services industry takes, the expansion of exports can give back, what with the continuing growth of the BRICS (金砖五国), no analogy for which existed in the 1930s. The ongoing decline of the dollar will be the mechanism bringing about this reallocation of resources. But the US economy is not going to be able to move unemployed investment bankers onto industrial assembly lines overnight.

       Ray Meyer was laid off from his job as a regional bank manager almost three years ago now. He finally gave in and started working with a temp agency. On the road back to work, a new job isn’t the final destination. It’s just a stopping point along the way.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       “Good morning, this is Ray. I’m on break from the temporary job that I have,” Meyer says in a recording made in the parking lot outside of his current workplace. “It’s good to be out and about and it’s certainly good to be in the morning traffic with everybody else.”
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Meyer is sitting in his purple Dodge Caravan. There’s a rust spot on the door, and it needs repairs more often than it used to. When Meyer bought it 14 years ago he never imagined he’d still have it today. But he also never imagined he’d be working for a temp agency making $15 an hour.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       “I just am finding that these temporary jobs that I’m working on tend to treat their temporary employees differently, and I guess because we’re disposable,” he says.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Meyer is still searching for a job in banking. He knows he won’t make what he did before, and likely wouldn’t even be in management. But it would still be so much better than this temp work.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       “My job just dismissed out last Thursday night. But the job didn’t tell me until I got home,” Meyer says. “The people I’m working through called me and let me know that I didn’t need to go back.”
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Meyer is disappointed, but there’s something more. The uncertainty of temp work is gnawing away at (使烦恼) him. It’s like every few months he relives his layoff.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       He says he takes his things home every night because he never knows if his key will work the next day. He’d never say it this way, but you can tell Meyer is still traumatized (使受精神创伤) by the loss of his banking job back in 2008.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       “I don’t know that I’ll ever feel safe again,” Meyer says. “Before, I felt like I was doing a good job and they pulled the rug right out from under me, and I just didn’t see it coming.”
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Meyer’s current temp job is supposed to last through October, but he isn’t counting on it going past September.

       The current global financial crisis, which has brought the financial system virtually to its knees, is a both cause and symptom of a deeper systemic crisis of capitalism.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       The left has been trumpeting (大肆宣扬) the crisis of capitalism for many years. And like the boy who cried wolf, the left’s cries can no longer be ignored if the flock is to be saved.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       The current crisis manifests profound, unresolved problems in the real economy. The combination of the weakness of underlying capital accumulation and the meltdown of the banking system is what’s made its potential for disaster so serious.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       There have been financial bubbles in South Africa that are likely to burst with similar results to those seen in the U.S. All the more so since South Africa not only has an unregulated derivatives market (衍生品市场) but is offering to make this practice subject to further deregulation under the World Trade Organization’s services agreement GATS.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Equally serious is the dependence of the South African economy on extremely unstable speculative capital to keep the economy afloat. For some years now we have been living beyond our means, where the costs of our imports far out-weigh revenue from exports. We are not earning sufficient foreign currency to pay for these imports, which, in turn, has made us dependent on attracting short-term speculative investment to allow us to continue on this unsustainable path. It encourages investment in the financial sector and consequently discourages investment in the real economy, such as in expanding factory production, agriculture, etc. Similarly, it imposes limits on public investment in social spending as government follows the same logic.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       All of this is an outcome of an economic policy which removed controls on the financial sector. This process, known as liberalization, made it easier for investors to take their money in and out of the country and to make greater profits from speculative investment. But it is precisely the policies of liberalization and deregulation that render the South African economy vulnerable to the global financial crisis.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       This brings us full circle: the financial crisis must be understood as an outcome of a weak capitalism unable to generate profit through investment in the productive sectors of the economy. Policies aimed at resolving the problems of growth are just aggravating the situation, exposing the system to repeated crisis.

        Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal is the longest canal and also one of the earliest canals in the world. The Canal, together with the Great Wall and Xinjiang Karez, is recognized as one of the three great ancient Chinese projects. As a great project carried out by ancient Chinese people, it is still in use today, and is regarded as one of the symbols of Chinese culture. It also plays an important role in the development and exchange of economy and culture between north and south China, especially in the development of the industrial and agricultural economy along the canal, thus creating enormous material and spiritual wealth for Chinese people. Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal was successfully included in the World Heritage List in 2014, thus becoming the 32nd world cultural heritage site in China.
