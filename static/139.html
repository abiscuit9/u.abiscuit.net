       W: I’m so glad I can finally take a few days off from work before the Christmas holiday. My kids get out of school in 5 days and I still have so much planning and shopping to do!
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       M: Oh, last minute Christmas shopping! Do you have a list?
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       W: I do! 13 items on my list. And, I’ve looked for the best sales. I’m buying 7 items online because internet shopping is so easy these days.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       M: Great! So, what are you buying online?
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       W: I’m buying electronics online, mostly. For example, David wants a new e-book reader, so I’m buying that online.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       M: Do you like the new e-book readers? I really like the old-fashioned way of reading books – I like to feel the paper and turn the pages. I know that electronic readers are convenient…but…
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       W: I know. I agree with you… but David really loves to read and an e-book reader is top of his list for Christmas!! Now Martha, she really wants a new doll and a new doll house! In fact, I have to rush over to the store to find that doll and doll house before they’re sold out!
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       M: I’m glad those days are behind me! I remember the stress when my kids were small… now they’re grown up it’s so easy to buy gifts for them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       W: I don’t mind! I love the looks on their young faces on Christmas morning!

       Plenty of things will grab a dog’s attention: tennis balls, funny smells, other dogs, and so on. But how about a TV channel?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       “Certainly,” say the producers of DogTV. DogTV is the first cable network channel to deliver 24-hour programs for dogs. The idea, they say, is that turning on the channel while you go out for the day will keep your pet stimulated, entertained and relaxed. It’s just like the basic kids’ program for those who have not learned their ABCs.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The programs are scientifically designed to attract dogs. “We have conducted three years of research on how dogs react to different stimulating factors,” said Miss Thomas, a senior manager at DogTV. For instance, she explained, “For dogs who suffer from separation anxiety, DogTV is a tool that might help ease them. By watching the programs, maybe they’re not getting into troubles, and they’re happier and more relaxed when you get home.”
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But can dogs actually watch, or benefit from, television? Well, the answer depends on whom you ask.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       “I think a lot of this is to make us feel better as opposed to making the pet happier,” said Dr. Wilson, an experienced animal doctor. “Your pet needs plenty of exercise and an interesting environment. You cannot just turn on the TV and hope your dog is going to get better.”
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Still, if the dog is paying attention to the screen, very likely it will enjoy what it sees. If the dog doesn’t enjoy it, he will find something else to do, like chew on the end of a sofa. In that way, shows specially designed for dogs “could be a part” in a program designed to reduce separation anxiety.
      </p>

       The legal drinking age varies from place to place, but it is generally between 18 and 21 years old. Some places permit the drinking of beer at age 18, but strong alcohol only at age 21. Other places permit drinking only at 21 or older. Young people therefore often drive from one place to another with less strict drinking laws.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Generally speaking, in the US, people aged between 18 and 21 are allowed to drive, vote, marry, raise children, keep full-time jobs, join the army and even buy guns, but NOT to have a glass of beer. In many places, people aged between 18 and 21 are allowed to go into bars but not allowed to drink. Another even more interesting aspect of American drinking-age laws is that in some places people below the legal drinking age are not even allowed to sell alcohol.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       In most places these drinking laws are fairly strictly observed. You may, for example, find people lining up to get into a bar and discover that the queue is caused by a guard on the door and he is asking everybody to show his ID card. If you ask the guard why he wants to look at people’s ID card, he will inform you that he actually wants to see if you reach the drinking age. In such situations Americans often show their driving licenses, which have their dates of birth written on them.

        Children and Ball Sports
       </b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       <br/>
       A) Ball sports are a great way to teach young children active skills and there are many different types of classes available. Your child doesn’t have to be a budding David Beckham or Michael Jordon to enjoy ball sports. Different types of classes are cropping up all over the country and provide a great way to encourage physical exercise and cognitive (认知的) skills for kids of all ages and stages.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       B) Shy kids who need a little extra encouragement to get involved can really benefit from ball sports. Experienced teachers have a great knack (窍门) of helping timid children to integrate themselves into the group without being pushy or over-bearing. This, coupled with lots of praise and hands-on help to master new skills, can really boost confidence and help a shy child overcome his insecurities. Regular classes can also create new friendships and it’s a good idea to encourage your child to get to know his new friends with out-of-class play dates or days out.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       C) Playing ball sports will encourage positive social skills and help your child to recognize the importance of working as a team, respecting others and what it means to be competitive. Ball sports are about participation, as opposed to individual learning where your child will be more inclined to compare himself to others. They also help to create a sense of belonging and partnership which are great for self-esteem and general enjoyment of the activity.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       D) Developing a child’s competitiveness while teaching him to both win and lose gracefully can help him tackle the obstacles and accept the setbacks that life will naturally include. Most types of ball sports will demonstrate the fundamental lessons of winning and losing – especially around pre-school age when team exercises and competitions are more common.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       E) Toddlers and pre-schoolers are naturally active – so much so that it can be a struggle for mums to keep up with them sometimes. Whilst these high levels of activity really serve to keep them happy and healthy, children do start to slow down and become less active as they grow up. Ball sports can help to install a positive attitude to physical exercise that can sow the seed for good habits in later life. They also pack a punch where health benefits are concerned and can help your child to concentrate more at school and have a strong and healthy heart. Exercise produces endorphins (内啡肽) which make children feel good about themselves. They will move more skillfully and be less stressed and maintain a healthy weight.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       F) Babies are naturally drawn to balls – from the noisy, colorful variety they can play with from birth to the spongy balls they can boot around the garden once they start to crawl and walk. There seems to be a growing trend for baby ball sports classes and mum groups so it’s worth checking your local listings to see what’s available.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       G) Whether it’s a simple ball pond you set up in the back garden or attendance at a weekly class, babies will love the colors, pace and feel ball sports have to offer, not to mention all those invaluable skills they’ll pick up – from improved hand-eye co-ordination to increased motor skills and socializing with other babies.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       H) There are a number of ball sports available – from traditional football. Great for encouraging physical agility (敏捷), focus and team skills, football is a great sport for active kids or those lacking in self-esteem. Available for tots from around two years (although some will start from around six months), children can also learn about football rules and discipline – even if they’re not implemented (实施) right away. In addition to dribbling, passing and kicking, younger children will also be taught the importance of concentration, co-ordination and sharing with others, including games with beanbags, hoops (大环, 大圈) and musical activities. Thanks to the likes of Wimbledon and high profile sports heroes, tennis is enjoying something of a revival where kids’ sports are concerned. Tennis classes usually take children from over four years old and have numerous benefits such as improved hand-eye co-ordination, concentration and focus skills. Then, whether it’s in the back garden, at the park or at a local bowling centre, bowls can be great fun for everyone – irrelevant of their age or level of ability. This flexibility means tots as young as one can grab a piece of the action and grasp some excellent active skills in the process – from concentration and balance to co-ordination and increased motor skills. Finally, basketball is an incredibly active, fast-paced game that relies heavily on good teamwork, quick passing of the ball and efficient aiming to get it through the hoop. The whole family can get involved and you can help your child learn all of the major skills basketball entails such as passing, bouncing, throwing and aiming.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I) The type of sport you go for really depends on your child’s age, what’s on offer locally, what they’re most interested in and what you think they will gain the most from.

       Before many people buy a car, a television or a washing machine, they shop around for the best deal. Yet, when some of these people find themselves in a position in which a second medical opinion is a good idea – when facing a difficult operation, for example, – they are unwilling to go further. Sometimes it doesn’t matter. But sometimes it can lead to the wrong treatment, even death. Health professionals say there are a variety of reasons why we fear that second opinion.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       A number of psychological roadblocks (障碍) get in the way of second medical opinions, but one of the most common ones is the fear of hurting the feelings of the doctor, and the possible result of that. People may think that in bringing up that they want to get a second opinion they are questioning the doctor’s ability, so in the interest of not hurting the feeling of him they don’t suggest it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Another reason people keep away from getting a second opinion is fear of the second doctor giving them worse news than the first. But the most important is that it’s in your self-interest to get another opinion, and it may not be worse.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Besides, most people respect their doctors, and regard them as with godlike qualities. So they trust their doctors are right, and don’t ask for a second opinion. In fact, it doesn’t even occur to them that they should. But you should remember that the doctor is a human being just like you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Finally, sickness may foster poor judgment. And sometimes, when people are sick, they become childlike. They put all types of good feelings onto the doctor and just let him take over. That might not be the best thing. Sometimes, obtaining that second opinion just seems like too much work or too much trouble.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But remember, the purpose of a second opinion is to collect information so that you can make as informed a decision as possible on your medical care. Sometimes getting that second medical opinion can mean the difference between life and death.

       Throwing criminals in prison is an ancient and widespread method of punishment, but is it a wise one? It does seem reasonable to keep wrongdoers in a place where they find fewer opportunities to hurt innocent people. The system has long been considered fair and sound by those who want to see the guilty punished and society protected. But the value of this form of justice is now being questioned by the very men who have to apply it – the judges.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Does it really help the society, or the victim, or the victim’s family, to put in prison a man who, while drunk at the wheel of his car, has injured or killed another person? It would be more helpful to make the man pay for his victim’s medical bills and compensate him/her for the bad experience, the loss of working time, and any other problems arising from the accident. If the victim is dead, in most cases the victim’s family would need some financial assistance.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And a young thief who spends time in prison may receive there a thorough education in crime from his fellow prisoners. Willingly or not, he has to associate himself with tough criminals who will drag him into more serious crimes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Such considerations have caused a number of judges to try some new forms of punishment for light criminals, which are unpleasant enough to discourage the offenders (违法者) from repeating their offenses, but safe for them because they are not exposed to dangerous company. They pay for their crime by helping their victims, financially or otherwise, or doing unpaid labor for their community; or perhaps, they take a job and repay their victim out of their salary. This sort of punishment is applied only to nonviolent criminals who are not likely to be dangerous to the public, such as forgers (伪造者), thieves, and drivers who have caused traffic accidents. The sentenced criminal has the right to refuse the new type of punishment if he prefers a prison term.
