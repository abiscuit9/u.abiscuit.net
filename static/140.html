      </p>
      <p>
       W: Oh yeah, that was from the graduation dance back in high school. That was so much fun, getting all dressed up and fancy. I wore a beautiful blue gown and my friend Cindy wore green.
      </p>
      <p>
       M: No, Cindy was wearing a yellow dress; it was my partner who wore green. You girls were so silly and noisy, walking proudly in your fancy dresses, acting like princesses from some fairy tales.
      </p>
      <p>
       W: Nonsense, we were calm and quiet.

       W: Hahaha, yeah, I had forgotten all about that. I wasn’t all to blame though, he dropped me right on my back during one of the dances. I’ve never been so sore and so attractive all at once! And what about you? You were just as clumsy as the rest of us!
      </p>

       M: Hey Christina. I took notes for you again in our Biology class this morning. Why did you even come to class? You fell asleep in the first 15 minutes of class and slept the entire rest of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       W: Thanks for taking notes, Marvin. I appreciate it a lot. Ugh, I feel horrible for lack of sleep and too much coffee. I’ve already had three cups of coffee this morning. I don’t know what I was thinking taking an 8 a.m. class! I have to go to class because Dr. Jones counts points for attendance.
      </p>
      <p>
       M: But this is the third time you’ve slept through Dr. Jones’ class. You really need to go to sleep earlier!
      </p>
      <p>
       W: I try to go to bed early - but I just lie in bed for hours waiting to fall asleep and then in the morning; I can barely get out of bed… So I drink a lot of coffee to try and stay awake … I don’t know what the problem is.
      </p>
      <p>
       M: Maybe you should try the new methods for sleep health and fitness.
      </p>
      <p>
       W: What? Sleep health and fitness?
      </p>
      <p>
       M: Yeah! Limited amount of coffee, moderate exercise, and consistent sleep routines night after night, like going to bed every night at 10:00 and waking up every morning at seven, even on Fridays and Saturdays for a while until your body gets used to the idea of a good night’s sleep again.
      </p>

       According to a world health expert, men in England are much more likely to get cancer than women because of their poor lifestyles. Figures show that men are 14 percent more likely to develop the disease than women in England. But Dr. Thompson, who is an expert in cancer research, says this is “not unavoidable” since it is mainly due to their bad diet and alcohol use.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Although men do more physical activities than women, they are less aware of the link between lifestyle and the disease. Each year nearly 150,000 men are found to suffer from cancer. In 2008 there were about 156,000 deaths from cancer in the UK – about 81,000 men and 75,000 women. Cancer causes 28 percent of deaths among men, the second highest compared with heart disease, which causes 37 percent of deaths. It is, therefore, important to provide men a health guide to improve their knowledge of how they can help protect themselves.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Dr. Thompson says, “Men have higher rates of many diseases than women, so it might sometimes seem like this is just a fact of life. But while it is true that there are some biological reasons for the difference, we need to get across the message that the higher rates of cancer in men are not unavoidable. Men should make changes in their lifestyle. They should eat more fruit and vegetables. They should maintain a healthy weight and cut down on alcohol. If they can do all these, men can make a real difference to their cancer risk.”

      <p style="text-align:justify">
       In 1995, Dr. Kataria, an Indian medical doctor, found that “laughter is the best medicine,” so he was determined to find a way to recommend laughter to his patients and others who needed it.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       At 4:00 a.m. on March 13, 1995, Dr. Kataria decided to start a laughter yoga club. At 7:00 that morning he went to a nearby park. He told many of the regular visitors about his idea of a laughter yoga club and asked them to laugh with him. Most of the people there replied, “Doctor, are you OK?” But four people agreed to laugh with him and, so the first laughter yoga club was born. A week later there were 55 people laughing together. Today there are over 5,000 laughter yoga clubs in more than 50 countries.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       At first, members of the new club told each other jokes and funny stories to stimulate laughter. After two weeks they ran out of positive jokes. Some of the ladies asked Dr. Kataria to stop the club because some people started to tell some negative jokes, and the ladies didn’t like them. But Dr. Kataria didn’t want to give up. He told them to come back the next day as he would have a new method for them.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Dr. Kataria discovered that according to research, human bodies couldn’t tell the differences between real laughter and “acted-out” laughter. However, the benefits were the same. The next morning he explained his finding to the group and asked them to try to act out laughing. They tried it and their acted-out laughters soon became real laughters. They laughed louder, longer and with more energy than ever before. Since then, more people began to accept laughter yoga.
      </p>
      <p>
       <br/>
       <p>
        How did the visitors in the park react when they were asked to laugh with Dr. Kataria?
       </p>
       <p>
        Which of the following numbers is closest to the real number of laughter yoga clubs in the world?
       </p>
       <p>
        Why did a few female club members ask Dr. Kataria to stop the club?
       </p>
       <p>
        What did Dr. Kataria do the next morning?

        International Students and Part-Time Jobs
       </b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       <br/>
       A) As an international student in Holland, you might want to take a part-time job, just as Dutch students do. Besides helping to cover your costs, a job can also give you useful work experience, allow you to participate in Dutch society and make it easier for you to learn the language. Your position as a job applicant is somewhat different from that of Dutch students, however.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       B) The easiest way to find a job is through an employment agency. Some agencies specialize in jobs for students. The student affairs office at the Dutch institution where you are enrolled can provide addresses or may even have their own job agency. Of course you can also respond to advertisements or search for a job on the Internet.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       C) Your position is different from that of Dutch students and you will have to take several practical restrictions into account, such as your probable lack of fluency in the Dutch language. It goes without saying that if you are enrolled in an English-taught program and have not had to learn any Dutch, certain jobs will be out of your reach. But even if you do speak Dutch, some jobs simply require the fluency of a native speaker. Always make sure you know about the relevant formalities and rules before you begin to look for a job.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       D) Dutch public healthcare insurance is called “basic care insurance”. Dutch law requires everyone in Holland with resident or employee status to take out public healthcare insurance. Students under the age of 30 who are in Holland solely for study purposes are exempt (被豁免的) from this general requirement and are allowed to have other insurance, such as private healthcare insurance. If you start a part-time job, however, you will immediately have to take out Dutch public healthcare insurance, since now you are no longer just a student, but also an employee. This applies no matter how many hours you work per week. You are advised to take this into consideration before starting a job, because Dutch public healthcare insurance may be more expensive than the insurance you otherwise use. This rule also applies to EU citizens who are covered by an EU Health Insurance Card. From the moment you start working, you need to take out Dutch public healthcare insurance. If you intend to work part-time on and off, make sure you choose an insurance company that allows you to switch between private and public healthcare insurance.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       E) As the costs of Dutch public healthcare insurance can weigh heavily on a small budget, the Dutch government provides a healthcare allowance to people with low incomes. If you are insured through a Dutch public healthcare insurance, you are eligible to apply for this healthcare allowance. Since the online application tool requires an electronic signature, it is generally easier to order an application form through your local tax office.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       F) Social security contributions will be deducted (扣除) from your gross pay. These deductions support the systems that provide disability pay and unemployment benefits – meaning that, as an employee, you will be insured against the consequences of any work-related accident. Your employer is obliged to deduct these social security contributions from your pay before you get it. These deductions can easily take up a third of your gross pay. Your employer’s human resources department can provide a detailed explanation of this and other elements of your pay slip.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       G) You are required to pay tax over your total Dutch income for the year. Scholarships may also be counted as income and added to the total. If you have both a scholarship that is taxed and a part-time job, you might receive less money than with only a scholarship. If you have a foreign scholarship and your country has signed a tax treaty (协议) with the Netherlands, it is possible that your scholarship will not be taxed in Holland (since according to Dutch law a person is only obliged to pay income tax in one country). Holland has tax treaties with many countries, including all EU member states.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       H) Before you start a job, it is wise to settle all the formalities with your employer, such as the number of holiday days you are entitled to, your insurance coverage and your tax situation. Also make sure you know the organization’s own rules and regulations regarding the terms of employment.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I) Some students take jobs in, for example, cafes and restaurants through unofficial channels, where the employer does not pay any social security contributions for them. The pay for such jobs is usually higher than for regular jobs, but it is important to realize that this practice (called “working in the black”) is illegal, and means that you cannot claim any rights as an employee. Moreover, you will not be insured in the event of a work-related accident. You should also be aware that if you need a work permit and your employer lets you work without one, he risks a high fine in the event of discovery. In the worst case you might even lose your residence permit.

      <p style="text-align:justify">
       While some men are considered to be “talkers”, many men tend to be less talkative than women especially in the context of a love relationship. A man’s silence may puzzle a woman to the point where it may “drive her crazy”. Due to this mystery, she may seek to interpret the combination of his silence, feelings and actions based on the common reasons that would cause her to remain silent. For example, when she is upset with him for some particular reason, she will give him the silent treatment to passively punish him.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What a woman may learn is that he and she think differently. She may process (处理) things through verbal (口头的) communication, whereas he may process things in silence within his “psychological cave”. This simply means that to work things out mentally and emotionally, women may prefer to talk it out whereas men may prefer to work it out alone. This is why he may withdraw in silence. Silence doesn’t necessarily mean disinterest, insensitivity (漠不关心) or being upset.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Men can drive at amazing speeds without a hint of fear, but it is a different matter for a number of them when it comes on to sharing feelings. From the perspective of a man, sharing certain feelings may give him an unwanted sense of weakness that he may think gives her the upper hand (占上风) psychologically.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       With the knowledge of how men process information and the challenge they have with sharing feelings, women can exercise more patience through understanding. She may ask him what he is thinking and feeling or give him time to share at his own pace. She should learn to avoid giving the “silent treatment” to his silence, and continue to share her feelings to encourage him to do the same.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       A man can make it easier for a woman to understand his silence by letting her know a little of what is going on in his soul. His blank silence can depress her need to communicate with him. From her side, she feels close to him not only when she hears his logical thoughts, but his feelings as well.

       If the ship is sinking, do you save yourself or risk your life to save others? The answer, it seems, depends on how long the sinking takes. If there’s enough time, you can switch from adrenalin (肾上腺素)-driven self-preservation (自我保护) to conscience (良知，良心)-driven self-sacrifice.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The viewpoints come from a new comparison of survival data from the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 with the loss of 1517 lives out of 2207, and the sinking of the Lusitania three years later, which killed 1198 passengers out of 1949.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The main difference between the two sinkings was time: it took two hours and 40 minutes for the Titanic to go down, while the Lusitania sank in just 18 minutes. The result: a huge difference in survivor descriptions.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       On the Lusitania, survival favored able-bodied men aged between 16 and 35, whose probability of surviving was 7.9 percent higher than that for all remaining passengers over 35 years old. On the Titanic, in contrast, the same group of men were 6.5 percent more likely to die than their elders. Children were 30.9 percent more likely to survive on the Titanic, compared with passengers over 35, while on the Lusitania children had no better survival chance.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The main reason, according to Benno Torgler of Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, is that simple adrenalin-driven survival instinct and bodily strength affected survival on the fast-sinking Lusitania. On the slow-sinking Titanic, by contrast, there was time for social norms of giving priority to women and children.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Strikingly, women of all ages on the Titanic had a probability of survival 53 percent higher than for men, compared with an 11 percent higher chance of dying on the Lusitania.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       “People say you only care about yourself, but the analysis shows that people will sacrifice themselves,” says Torgler. “But time is crucial, because the elements that restart social interactions only emerge after time.”
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The results also support director James Cameron’s interpretation of events in his film Titanic – that wealth and social status regained its power after time, possibly through bribery (贿赂) or favors from the crew. First-class passengers on the Titanic had huge survival advantages unavailable on the Lusitania.
