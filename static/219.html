       W: “Scary me” instead of “marry me”?
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       M: Well you know me, Mom, I worry sometimes. So, when I brought the ring out, my hands were shaking and sweating. I dropped the ring in the grass! Of course it was already sunset, and getting dark…. Couldn’t see it…
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       W: What? So you’re down on one knee, with an empty ring box in your hand, your brand-new engagement ring lost in the grass? What a disaster!

      <p style="text-align:justify">
       M: Well, almost. Molly looks at me, says: “Nathan, you’re holding an empty box and asking me to marry you?” I told her “Yes! – Trying to, at least!” You know Molly, always prepared, – pulled out a small flash light from her purse, found the ring, put it on her own finger. Said: “Yes!” Kissed me. Then, we both burst out crying.
      </p>

       Teenagers are critical of their parents at times and blame them for most of the misunderstandings between them. For example, parents are out of touch with modern ways; they are so possessive and dominant that they do not trust their children to deal with any problems; they talk too much about certain problems; they have no sense of humor in parent-child relationships.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I think it is true that parents often underestimate their teenage children and also forget how they themselves felt when they were young.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Young people often annoy their parents with their choice of clothes, hairstyles, entertainment and music. This is not their motive. They feel cut off from the adult world into which they have not yet been accepted. So they create a culture and society of their own. Then, if it turns out that their music, entertainment, vocabulary, clothes or hairstyles upset their parents, this gives them additional enjoyment. They feel that they are superior, at least in a small way, and that they are leaders in style and taste.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Sometimes they are resistant and proud because they do not want their parents to approve of what they do. If their parents do approve, it looks as if they are betraying their own age group. But in that case, they are assuming that they are the likely loser. They can’t win but at least they can keep their honor. This is a passive way of looking at things. It is natural enough that, after long years of childhood, they are completely under their parents’ control. But it ignores the fact that they are now beginning to be responsible for themselves.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       If they plan to control their life, cooperation can be part of that plan. They can charm others, especially their parents, into doing things the way they want. They can impress others with their sense of responsibility and initiative, so that people will give them the authority to do what they want to.
      </p>
      <p>
       <br/>
       <p>
        Which of the following is one of the causes that teenagers blame their parents?
       </p>
       <p>
        Why do young people tend to have strange clothes and hairstyles?
       </p>
       <p>
        Why do teenagers not want their parents to approve of whatever they do?
       </p>
       <p>
        What are teenagers advised to do to improve parent-child relationships?

       For most of us, the purpose of the holiday season is to bring peace, love and goodwill towards all. Yet, for many, the holiday season often means stress, fatigue, pressure, disappointment and loneliness. These feelings, often known as the “holiday blues,” may be even more common, due to the emotional confusion of the past few months, not to mention the unsteady economy. Experts say even the more ritual tasks of shopping, decorating, late-night parties, cooking, planning and family gatherings can be sources of holiday stress. In addition, the psychological phenomenon known as seasonal emotional disorder may bring a specific type of depression related to winter’s shorter days and longer nights.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Certainly just because it’s the holidays doesn’t mean that people are going to be happy. And this will be particularly hard for those who are dealing with a lost job, debt, or even a lost loved one. With family reunions becoming less frequent events over the years, there is now the added pressure of getting just one chance to get it all right. Since families are becoming more complex now, the disappointment and even strangeness that often result from family gatherings are actually a realization that the fantasy is not met.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Still the blues should be addressed. The most essential step is for the individual to acknowledge their feelings and try to deal with them. Denial will only increase the stress they’re feeling. People need to do things that are normally comforting in order to get a handle on their holiday stress. If they’re feeling a little blue, they should try to do things personally satisfying for them. Maybe this is exercise, cooking, reading a book, etc.

        The Courage to Know Oneself
       </b>
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       A) I have had a lot of fear in my life. Much of the fear started when I was about nine years old and developed into an unbearable fear of dying. I would lie in bed at night, knowing that I was eventually going to lose everything I owned. Then I cherished life itself very much. “Why was I born if only to die?” was the question that plagued me. I literally could not sleep at night. And I could find no comfort from either of my parents. So I learned to deal with it by controlling my breath (I thought if I kept breathing, I would stay alive). This habitual activity deadened (使麻木) my spontaneity and inner freedom for decades to come.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       B) This issue wasn’t resolved until I finally faced death directly within myself and saw what I was really afraid of was not death, but aloneness – existential aloneness – being all alone forever. And when I opened to this aloneness, needing to know what it really was, my consciousness opened to my wholeness and my interconnectedness with all existence. And I have not been lonely or afraid in the way I used to be since that defining moment.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       C) This story exemplifies the underlying principle of courage. Having courage does not mean that one does not have fear. It means that one is willing to face fear – to face fear itself in order to know the truth about something. In a very real sense, one could say that fear is the separation from the truth, and that courage is the willingness to go through fear to get to the truth. All fears, then, refer back to the one fear that is our separation from the truth of who and what we really are – our true nature, our undivided and interconnected self.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       D) The word “courage” comes from Latin and French derivatives that mean “heart”. So when people ask me what courage is, I often tell them that it is heart-work, learning how to move through fear.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       E) Every little fear becomes a doorway to a larger, less fearful part of ourselves, if we can just allow ourselves to be open and vulnerable to it, curious about it – needing to understand it and having to know the truth. Every time we face a fear, we learn that we have the ability to move through fear, we become a little more courageous in our lives, and we get a little closer to the truth.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       F) I often say that the difference between a child and an adult is that the child retreats from fear – chooses to stay stuck in their fear of the fear whereas the adult faces fear – chooses to move through their fear of the fear, into and through the fear itself.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       G) So, in order to fully understand courage, we need to understand why we would choose to not face our fear, but to continue to be afraid of it. Why would we choose to stay stuck in a limited, tight, fearful place when we could be free and open and joyous?
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       H) This, of course, is a huge question. But I think there are a few key things we can see that will be very useful. The first question that arises in this inquiry is, “What is it that we’re really afraid of, anyway?”
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       I) There’s an old Jewish expression that translates roughly into “Don’t look too deep”. I think the expression is based on the belief that what is deepest inside of us is fundamentally not good – original sin (罪恶), the id, etc. So, if one should sincerely seek the truth, what he will ultimately discover is that one’s true nature is bad. And how could one live with that knowledge? And so we are afraid of looking into things for fear that we won’t like what we find. From my experience, however, what I have found to be deepest inside myself (and all beings) is pure love, compassion, wisdom, and understanding. It’s just a matter of looking deeply enough to see what’s there.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       J) We are also afraid of letting go of the known – what we have known. Even though we may be aware of our suffering, at least we are familiar with it. We may even have become comfortable with it in a peculiar sort of way. We have made a kind of pact with our suffering: “I won’t bother challenging you if you promise not to get any worse.” In essence, we are afraid to change because we have an unconscious belief that things will get worse if we let go of what we know. What I have learned, however, is that the only place where there is true peace is in the place of absolute letting go of what we have known. From this place, I am able to respond freely and directly to the circumstances of my life.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       K) We have taken on an identity, an image, a set of beliefs about what we and the surrounding world are all about. We see our lives through this set of beliefs. If we were to let go of these ideas about what reality is, we are afraid we would no longer know what is real. And that is a frightening prospect for us. We are afraid that our world would be chaotic and even terrifying. We are afraid that the universe is not a benevolent (慈善的) place.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       L) And so we cling desperately to a set of beliefs about who we are and what the world is. All the beliefs were created (primarily in an attempt to protect ourselves from experiencing pain) very early in our childhood, and are buried deep in our subconscious. These beliefs or self-images serve to separate us from the reality and are actually the source of all our fears and all our sufferings. It is only by challenging or inquiring into these beliefs that we can move through our fears and come to know our true, courageous, free, open, loving, and peaceful self. The great poet, Rainer Maria Rilke once said, “The spiritual path is one of being defeated by greater and greater beings.” In the process of inquiring into, seeing into and letting go of our false selves, one’s awareness opens increasingly to the beauty and awe that is always present.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       M) One could then say that courage is being more committed to knowing the truth than protecting one’s cherished ideas and images about oneself and the world. What beliefs do you cling to? And are you courageous enough to challenge them?

       Starvation is the most fearful and the most dreaded of all the anxieties that haunt (萦绕) the minds and the imaginations of mankind. Mankind’s every effort has been directed to combat it and will continue to do so until the end of time. Its prevention has been the greatest motivation that ever kept men
       <u>
        braced up
       </u>
       in the struggle. It is the real enemy. Yet like every other enemy its presence brings forth the best that is in us and urges us to do greater things in the struggle. In the continuous fight against hunger and cold, man has progressed wonderfully and done more than what was absolutely necessary to merely guard against starvation. His future progress can only be made through keeping up the fight.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       The fight is the same now as it was when our early ancestor struggled with some living things and with their flesh satisfying his inward desire and with their skin keeping out the cold so that he might live, and for the time being to keep the anxiety at bay. The forces we have to fight now are different, but the struggle is the same. As he succeeded in conquering his victim to make his existence secure, so must we conquer the forces that are opposed to us or we will perish. Unlike our early ancestor, whose task is simple in the struggle for existence, we have to fight not only the natural conditions, but artificial ones which society has created.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       In the struggle we have conquered as far as getting enough to eat and enough to wear is concerned, for we have produced both in abundance and far in excess of what our necessities require. Foodstuffs are gathered and harvested every year in quantities so great that their consumption would be impossible. Various clothing material is manufactured in such quantities that nakedness should have become impossible. We have achieved so much in providing food and clothing that it is strange that some are still hovering on the brink of starvation. Productivity is continuously increasing and the quality of production is continually improving. Yet with all this we are haunted by starvation. Its dread presence is ever felt.
