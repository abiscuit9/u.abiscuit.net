       M: Thanks Mom. Iced green tea sounds great. Sooooooo, I failed my driving test! Failed!! All my friends will be driving to basketball games and going out to have dinner! They will drive to movies and out to coffee shops. I’ve dreamed of driving for sooooooo long.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       M: I know … I know … but I’ve been saving up my money for four years from my part time job – to have enough money to buy a used car … AND I’ve been looking every day ... at a beautiful silver car!

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       W: Aw James! You are a great kid! And we’re really proud of you; you have worked hard. Let’s go look at that silver car. And, you can take the driving test again in a few weeks. I’m sure you’ll pass next time!

       Learning disabilities are very common; they affect perhaps 10 percent of all children, among whom about 80 percent are boys.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You cannot always look at the children and tell if they have a learning disability. There are often no obvious signs of the disorder, so some researchers began looking at the brain itself to learn what might be wrong. There is no longer any question that all learning disabilities result from differences in the way the brain is organized.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       In one study, researchers examined the brain of a learning-disabled person who had died in an accident. They found two unusual things. One involved cells in the left side of the brain, which control language. These cells normally are white. In the learning-disabled person, however, these cells were gray. The researchers also found that many of the nerve cells were not organized in a line the way they should have been. The nerve cells were all mixed together.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       The study was carried out under the guidance of Dr. Jones, an expert on learning disabilities. Dr. Jones suggested that learning disabilities resulted mainly from problems in the left side of the brain. “Probably,” he said, “nerve cells there did not connect as they should.”
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Other researchers measured the brain’s electrical activity and made a map of the electrical signals. Dr. Duffy, another expert on learning disabilities, experimented with this technique at a children’s hospital medical center. He found large differences in the brain activity of normal children and those with reading problems. The differences appeared throughout the brain. Dr. Duffy said his research provides evidence that reading disabilities involve damage to a wide area of the brain, not just to the left side.
      </p>
      <p>
       <br/>
       <p>
        How many children with learning disabilities are girls?
       </p>
       <p>
        What did Dr. Jones’s study find about the learning-disabled person who died in an accident?
       </p>
       <p>
        How did Dr. Duffy study the cause for learning disabilities?
       </p>
       <p>
        According to Dr. Duffy, what damage do reading disabilities involve?

       In the 20th century, new challenges for the railway industry in cities emerged. Road travel became much more comfortable as road surfaces improved. Buses offered convenient stops and cheaper fares, as they usually got support from local governments. They became the preferred means of city transport. By 1910, twice as many people traveled on buses as by train. The development of railways stopped for the first time. Some passenger services were even closed.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Carriages were improved to win back customers, but the railway industry’s most effective response was to electrify lines in the countryside. Electric trains were faster and safer. When they were introduced, they brought about a major improvement in the lives of country folks.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       During the First World War, the London &amp; South Western Railway Company began to electrify lines from the countryside to London, where most of the population lived. By the mid-1930s, the company operated the largest network of its kind in the world and its regular services had effectively served many towns on the south coast of Britain.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       However, unlike the London &amp; South Western Railway, other railway companies were reluctant to spend huge amounts of money on electrification. For example, one company only chose to improve its steam services. Even when lines were electrified, there was no uniform system. Different electric currents were used across the network and power was transmitted through both rails and overhead wires. When a nationwide electrification project was recommended in 1931, it was postponed because of high costs and then the war. Many ideas of the project were not adopted until the 1960s.

        Heroism in the Fire and Rescue Service
       </b>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align:justify">
       <br/>
       A) HSE (卫生安全管理局) fully endorses (签署) the recommendation in “Common Sense, Common Safety” that individual firefighters should not be at risk of investigation or prosecution (起诉), under health and safety law, if they have put themselves at risk as a result of a heroic act.  The following outlines how HSE defines heroism and explains how HSE will deal with such matters. Striking the balance between operational duties and health and safety in the fire and rescue service recognizes the particularly challenging nature of fire and rescue activity and the extremely dangerous environments in which firefighters have to work. It explains how fire and rescue services can comply with health and safety while delivering an effective operational service.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       B) The statement makes it clear that fire and rescue services need to manage all foreseeable risk effectively and to review their operational procedures in the light of experience.  It also sets out the duties of individual firefighters, cooperating with their employer, taking reasonable care of themselves, and not endangering others.  This means that firefighters should act sensibly and responsibly within the command and control of their employer; they should not act recklessly.  It is also important to recognize that firefighters should not be expected to put themselves at unreasonable risk, even in the face of sometimes unrealistic public expectations.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       C) HSE views the actions of firefighters as truly heroic when it is clear that they have decided to act entirely of their own volition (意愿) in putting themselves at risk to protect the public or colleagues and there have been no orders or other directions from senior officers to do so and their actions have not put other firefighters at similar high risk.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       D) Firefighting is a complex activity requiring clear definition of roles and responsibilities on the incident ground and is normally undertaken by teams of firefighters. It is important that command and control discipline is maintained to ensure the safety of firefighters and others.  But there are some circumstances when firefighters work together. In a fast-moving dangerous situation, they may decide to put themselves at risk when they have not received specific orders or there is no relevant safe working procedure for them to follow.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       E) In those rare cases when a firefighter does perform an act of heroism, the Fire and Rescue Service may recognize and commend them for their bravery.  HSE will view the actions of individual firefighters as heroic when it is clear that they have decided to act entirely of their own volition, they have put themselves at risk to protect the public or colleagues and the individuals' actions were not likely to have put other officers or members of the public at serious risk.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       F) In the event of HSE being notified of a serious incident, inspectors may need to make initial enquiries about the nature of the incident and may need to conduct an investigation of the Service's operational arrangements and management of health and safety. If, during this investigation, it becomes clear, however, that the incident involved an act of heroism by individual firefighters, then HSE will not investigate the actions of the individuals.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       G) During a fire at a large factory, a Breathing Apparatus team of four firefighters were deployed into the building in search of two people reported as still inside the building. The firefighters went to the location where the people had last been seen and found both of them there. These people told the firefighters that one of their colleagues was still in an adjacent room. The BA team attempted to inform the Entry Control Officer by radio but found that radio communications had been lost, probably because of the size and type of building. The BA team withdrew from the immediate high risk area to a safer part of the building and agreed to split into two teams of two. One team was able to help the casualties safely out of the building and inform colleagues outside of the proposed course of action to be taken by the BA team still in the building. The remaining BA team realized that conditions in the building were deteriorating rapidly due to increase in heat intensity and objects falling around them.  Because of this, even though the adjacent room presented a greater risk and there was a real possibility that they would not be able to escape safely, they decided to go on into the fire in order to rescue the other member of the public. They made this decision knowing that had radio communications remained live, they would have been instructed in accordance with their standard procedure to wait for additional support and resource. This team managed to rescue an unconscious casualty and withdraw to an agreed position to meet an oncoming emergency team to help them safely out of the factory.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       H) In the absence of instruction from senior officers, the team of four firefighters made their decisions based on their comprehensive training. All were fully aware of the risks and agreed on their actions without instruction or pressure from officers.  The actions of the four firefighters did not place colleagues or members of the public at greater risk.  The Incident Commander effectively applied the FRS procedures which were in line with incident command and control procedures.

       Our fears of public speaking result not only from what we do not know or understand about public communication but also from misconceptions (误解) and myths (错误观念) about public interactions.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Perhaps the most popular myth about public communication is that it is a “special” activity reserved for unusual occasions. After all, how often do you make a public speech? There are only a few special occasions during the year when an outgoing professional person will step onto a platform to give a public speech, and many professional people can count on one hand the number of speeches given in the career.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       This argument, of course, ignores the true nature of public communication and the nature of the occasions in which it occurs. When we engage with people we do not know well to solve problems, share understanding and opinions, advocate points of view, or seek stimulation, we are engaged in public speaking. Public communication is a familiar, daily activity that occurs in the streets, in restaurants, courtrooms, parks, offices, factories and meetings.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       A related misconception about public communication is the belief that
       <i>
        the public speaker is a specially gifted individual
       </i>
       . While most professional people would reject the idea that public speakers are born, not made, they nevertheless often feel that the effective public communicator has developed unusual personal talents to a remarkable degree. At the heart of this misconception – like the myth of public speaking as a “special” activity – is an overly narrow view of what a public person is and does.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Development as an effective public communicator begins with the understanding that you need not be a nationally-known speaker to be a competent (合格的) public person. The public speaker is an ordinary person who faces the necessity of being a public person.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Once we understand what public interactions assume and demand, once we unburden ourselves of the myth about public speaking, we can properly begin to develop as competent public communicators.

       It is generally believed that improper human activities contribute to global warming. But this belief is facing an inconvenient challenge after the release of new temperature data showing the planet has not warmed for the past 15 years. Based on statistics from more than 30,000 measuring stations, the data confirms that the rising trend in world temperatures ended in 1997. The figures also suggest that we could even be heading for a mini ice age comparable to the 70-year temperature drop in the 17th century.

      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Meanwhile, climate scientists said that, after releasing unusually high levels of energy throughout the 20th century, the sun is now heading toward a “grand minimum” in its output (输出). This is likely to cause cold summers, bitter winters and a shortening of the season available for growing food.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Solar output goes through 11-year cycles, with high numbers of sunspots (太阳黑子) seen at their peak. We are now at what should be the peak of what scientists call “Cycle 24”. But sunspot numbers are running at less than half those seen during cycle peaks in the 20th century. Analysis by experts suggests that Cycle 25, whose peak is due in 2022, will be a great deal weaker still.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       According to a paper published last week, there is a 92 percent chance that both Cycle 25 and those taking place in the following decades will be as weak as, or weaker than the period of 1790 to 1830. In that period, average temperatures in parts of Europe fell by 2℃. It is also possible that the new solar energy drop could be as deep as what happened between 1645 and 1715 when the canals of Holland froze solid.
