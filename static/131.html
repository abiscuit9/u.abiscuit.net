       W: Hi David. We’re all going to the Sports Bar to watch our city team’s basketball game this Saturday. Would you like to join us? We’ve missed you!
      </p>
      <p>
       M: Thanks! Wendy. But I’m not sure … I’ve always loved watching basketball games with all of you – and having a few beers and snacks … I’m just not sure if I can join you..
      </p>
      <p>
       W: Why not? Are you busy this Saturday night?
      </p>
      <p>
       M: Nooooo. It’s not that I’m busy, but you remember I had that minor heart attack seven months ago? Well, I just saw my doctor again last week and he said that I have to improve my fitness level or I’m very likely to have another heart attack!
      </p>
      <p>
       W: Wow, that’s frightening!
      </p>
      <p>
       M: Yeah! I know! So, I’ve been on a diet to lose weight and started an exercise program, too. So, no more high-fat snacks for me and I’ve stopped drinking all alcohol which of course includes beer... but at least I’ve lost five pounds!
      </p>
      <p>
       W: Well David, I hope you’ll still consider coming – you can skip the beer and high-fat snacks! You haven’t joined us in watching a game for a long time, and besides, the city team is playing for the championship.
      </p>
      <p>
       M: OK! I’ll go! I’ll see you Saturday at four at the Sports Bar. I’ll just make sure to order diet sodas and low-fat snacks!

      </p>
      <p>
       W: Oh honey, I know how you feel. When I was a freshman, I was so scared of being away from home for the first time. Back then, I couldn’t just email my parents or call home any time I wanted. I would get a letter from my mom every week and I saved up for the first three months to call her.
      </p>
      <p>
       M: Three months?! Why so long?
      </p>
      <p>
       W: It cost three dollars per minute to make long-distance telephone calls back then, but it was worth every penny. My mom never went to college, and getting her children an education meant the world to her! When I first heard her voice, tears welled up in my eyes, and I just wanted to run home. I knew how disappointed she would be though, and I fought to keep the sadness out of my voice. After the first semester, I was settled in and having a great time! So, just wait and you’ll see.
      </p>
      <p>
       M: I guess you’re right. I need to give it more time. Still, I don’t have to wait a week for a letter and it doesn’t cost much to hear your voice, but I really miss you Mom!

      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Here is good news for anyone who has spent more time than they should in online chat rooms: A British psychologist has found that relationships started in the virtual world can very well lead to true love.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Many “virtual” relationships develop well once potential partners meet face-to-face because they already know each other so well through their online contacts, said Dr. Jones, a lecturer in psychology.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       “Chat rooms don’t lead to shallow relationships,” Dr. Jones said in an interview. “They lead to really close relationships because people express themselves more freely and are comfortable talking openly on the Internet.”
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Jones carried out in-depth interviews with 42 regular chat room users aged 19 to 26 years old. Of the users he studied, 29 reported close friendships or romantic relationships with people they met online, with 21 progressing to face-to-face meetings. One couple became engaged.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       “What tends to happen is that, when they meet, it’s a fairly smooth transition from online to offline because they know each other so well,” said Jones. “Online, guys can be more honest and sincere, while women can be more attractive.”
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       His research also showed that most chat room users tell a few small lies about their height or the color of their hair. “They still seem to obey the social
       <i>
        standards about the body image
       </i>
       ,” said Jones. “So the guys are likely to make themselves sound blue-eyed, while the women add a bit of light color to their hair or increase their height slightly.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <br/>
       <p>
        What does Jones say about the relationships started online?
       </p>
       <p>
        How many people did Jones interview for his report?
       </p>
       <p>
        Why can chat room users become close friends?
       </p>
       <p>
        What can be concluded about most chat room users?

       My name is Karl Malone. I was an NBA basketball player from 1985 to 2004. In my family I was the youngest of five boys and I also had four sisters. My dad died when I was three years old, leaving Mom with the job of providing for nine kids. In order to make ends meet, she hardly ever rested. She believed in doing all she could to take care of her responsibilities. You can imagine, we kids didn’t always get what we wanted, but we always got the things we needed. With my mom as my example, I learned that hard work is the best way to get what you want.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       I had many dreams about what I wanted to be when I grew up, but regardless of what I chose, I wanted to make my brothers, sisters and Mom proud of me – not only by being successful in what I chose to do, but also as a person who could be respected for the right reasons.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       In junior high school, I started playing basketball for a team. No matter what I did, some people waited for my failure, and they said, “Karl Malone can’t do it.” Instead of letting these people get to me, I actually made them become my driving force and I continued to prove them wrong every single day.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       I am grateful for the life I’ve enjoyed as a basketball star. Basketball is exciting, but the most important thing about it is that it gives me a way to do good things for others. Success is really about making a positive contribution to the world around you and valuing the things that are really important – like family and friends.

        Should Students be Paid for Good Grades?
       </b>
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       A) Back in the day, a good report card earned you a parental pat on the back, but now it could be money in your pocket. Experiments with cash incentives (激励) for students have been catching on in public-school districts across the country, and so has the debate over whether they are a brilliant tool for hard-to-motivate students or bribery (贿赂) that will destroy any chance of fostering a love for learning. Either way, a rigorous (严谨的) new study – one of relatively few on such pay-for-performance programs – found that the programs get results: Cash incentives help low-income students stay in school and get better grades.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       B) According to a study released today by the social-policy research group MDRC, a nonpartisan (无党派的) organization perhaps best known for evaluating state welfare-to-work programs, cash incentives combined with counseling offered “real hope” to low-income and nontraditional students at two Louisiana community colleges. The program for low-income parents, funded by the Louisiana Department of Social Services and the Louisiana Workforce Commission, was simple: enroll in college at least half-time, maintain at least a C average and earn $1,000 a semester for up to two terms. Participants, who were randomly selected, were 30 percent more likely to register for a second semester than students who were not offered the supplemental financial aid. And the participants who were first offered cash incentives in spring 2004 – and thus whose progress was tracked for longer than that of subsequent groups before Hurricane Katrina abruptly forced researchers to suspend the survey for several months in August 2005 – were also more likely than their peers to be enrolled in college a year after they had finished the two-term program.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       C) Students offered cash incentives in the Louisiana program didn’t just enroll in more classes; they earned more credits and were more likely to attain a C average than nonparticipants. And they showed psychological benefits too, reporting more positive feelings about themselves and their abilities to accomplish their goals for the future. “It’s not very often that you see effects of this magnitude for anything that we test,” notes Thomas Brock, MDRC’s director for young adults and postsecondary-education policy.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       D) Although US college enrollment has climbed, college completion rates have not. Only a third of students who enroll in community colleges – which educate nearly half the undergraduates in the US – get a degree within six years. Hence the interest in this study among such philanthropic (慈善的) powerhouses as the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, which helped fund the MDRC study. (MDRC, by the way, was created in 1974 by the Ford Foundation and a group of federal agencies; originally named the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, it now goes only by the abbreviation.)
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       E) Given that the follow-up study of the program was disrupted as the schools struggled to rebuild enrollment and facilities in the wake of Katrina, it’s difficult to draw any long-term conclusions about the effects that cash incentives will have on community-college students. However, there could soon be more data to parse: with a grant from the Gates Foundation, MDRC plans to test cash incentives at community and state colleges in California, New Mexico, New York and Ohio.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       F) Despite the impressive, though short-term results of the study, some critics in higher education are concerned that cash incentives will encourage students to start taking easier courses to ensure they’ll do well enough to pocket the money. “Everyone knows what the gut classes are when they’re in college,” notes Kirabo Jackson, an assistant professor of labor economics at Cornell who has studied cash incentives for high school students. “By rewarding people for a GPA, you’re actually giving them an impetus to take an easier route through college.” Other critics note that students’ internal drive to learn may be sapped (削弱) as they focus on getting an external reward.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       G) But those involved with the study note that particularly in this economy, cash incentives could help part-time students devote more hours to their studies. Faced with soaring bills for tuition, books and housing, many college students need a job just to get by. In the Louisiana program, all the participants were low-income parents, three-quarters of whom were unmarried or living without a partner. “We’re talking about adults who have quite a number of other responsibilities,” says Brock. “When you’re talking about minors who are required by law to be in school, that’s a different situation.”
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       H) Arnel Cosey, assistant vice chancellor for student affairs and provost (教务长) for the City Park Campus at New Orleans’ Delgado Community College, one of two schools in the study, says she understands why some people are concerned that cash incentives are nothing more than bribery. “But on the other hand, I think because I am involved with these students daily, I’m not sure that I’m opposed to bribing,” she says. “If that’s what we need to do for these people to reach these goals, which ultimately will lead to them having a better life, I wish I had more money to give.”
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       I) Besides, as Cosey adds, if all goes well, students will be getting cash incentives for their work soon after graduating – in the form of a paycheck. “Most of us wouldn’t turn up at work every day if we weren’t getting a check,” she says. “What’s wrong with starting the payment a little early?”

       Everybody lies. It may only be “white lies”, but everyone tells lies or “omits the truth” sometimes. People start lying at around age 4 to 5 when children gain an awareness of the use and power of language. This first lying is not ill-natured, but rather to find out, or test, what can be controlled in a child’s environment. Eventually children begin to use lying to get out of trouble or get something they want. White lies, those told to protect someone’s feelings, are not a big deal at all. The person, however, who seems to feel forced to lie about both small and large stuff, has a problem. They lie to protect themselves, look good, gain financially or socially and avoid punishment. A much more troubling group is those who lie a lot, and knowingly, for personal gain. Lying often gets worse with the passage of time. When you get away with a lie, it often forces you to continue your lies.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Why do we dislike liars so much? It’s a matter of trust. When people lie, they have broken a bond – an unspoken agreement to treat others as we would like to be treated. Serious lying often makes it impossible for us to trust another person again. Because the issue (问题) of trust is at risk, coming clean about the lie as soon as possible is the best way to mend fences. If the truth only comes out once it is forced, repair of trust is far less likely. As a parent, the most important message you can send to your children about lying is that you always – always – want them to come clean with you. No matter how small a lie they have told, remind them that you would always rather hear the truth, no matter how bad it is, than be cheated. Tell them there is really nothing better in your relationship than your trust of each other.

       For many people today, reading is no longer relaxation. To keep up their work they must read letters, reports, trade publications, interoffice communications, not to mention newspapers and magazines: a never-ending flood of words. In getting a job or advancing in one, the ability to read and comprehend quickly can mean the difference between success and failure. Yet the unfortunate fact is that most of us are poor readers. Most of us develop poor reading habits at an early age, and never get over them. The main problem lies in language itself – words. Single words have little meaning until they are combined into phrases, sentences and paragraphs. Unfortunately, however, the untrained reader does not read groups of words. He reads one word at a time, often regressing to reread words or passages. Regression, or looking back over what you have just read, is a common bad habit in reading. Another habit which slows down the speed of reading is vocalization – sounding each word either orally or mentally as one reads.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       To overcome these bad habits, some reading clinics use a device called accelerator (加速器), which moves a bar down the page at a predetermined speed. The bar is set at a slightly faster rate than the reader finds comfortable, in order to “stretch” him. The accelerator forces the reader to read fast, making word-by-word reading, regression and vocalization virtually impossible. At first, comprehension is sacrificed for speed. But when you learn to read ideas, you will not only read faster, but your comprehension will improve. Many people have found their reading skills improved a lot after some training.
