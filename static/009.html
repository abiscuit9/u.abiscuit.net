       The typical workplace is changing. It’s no longer a large building with boring rooms.  Many technology companies are creating unique workplaces for their workers. Some companies have music, game rooms and gyms so workers can relax or exercise.  Some companies even have a slide that workers can use instead of taking the stairs or an elevator. It may seem like people wouldn’t want to work with all of these activities that are available. However, most workers understand that they’re lucky to work in a place like that, so they’re careful to be responsible and productive.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Many companies also offer workers free food all day long and usually have a real kitchen for them to use. Workers can bring their pets to work at some companies too.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       People may wonder why companies would have this type of relaxing environment.  These companies believe that making workplace fun and interesting leads to more creativity and exchange of ideas.

      <div style="text-align: justify;">
       One day in early July, a huge dead whale was found on a California beach. It caused many problems because the smell was bad, and it was unhealthy for the people at the beach. Officials put a rope around the dead whale and used two boats to pull it into the ocean. At first, the whale was too heavy, so the rope broke. They tried again later and were successful.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       However, this was not the last time the whale returned to a California beach. In the next two weeks, the same dead whale came back to a different beach. Each time boats pulled the whale back into the ocean, it came back due to the ocean tides. Finally, after taking the whale back to the ocean six times, the officials decided they must do something different. They decided they must cut the body of the dead whale and bury the pieces.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Biologists aren’t sure why the whale died, but they believe it was old and died naturally.
       <br/>

        What was the incident at a California beach in early July?
       </p>
       <p>
        Why did the same dead whale come back from the ocean?

       W: Hey Mike! Want to come to a dance party this Saturday?
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       M: Not again Joyce, I don’t  like dancing. You invite me to a different event 3 times a week. The pool party, the bowling trip, golfing, and now dancing!
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       W: Yes, I know. But you do need to come out eventually. You’ve been here at the University of Washington for two months now! What are you so busy doing all day?

       M: I like to come home and play video games. I spend time with my friends online, I don’t need to waste more time meeting new people on campus.

       W: I know you have friends from high school, but have you met anyone here on campus?

       M: Look Joyce, maybe if you did things I enjoy…
      </p>

       W: Plus Mike, you might also like to know that there are already 15 girls signed up for the dance and only five guys. That’s a pretty good ratio, right? Three girls for every guy?
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       M: Three girls!? Three girls to every one guy at the dance?
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       W: Yep! Plus your neighbors in the dorm next door, Emily, Miranda, and Carol, will be there.
      </p>

       M: Is Miranda the one with black hair?
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       W: Hah! I knew you had eyes for her. You have lots in common too. She’s a biology student and she’ll be taking chemistry next semester.

      </p>

       In countries destroyed by continuous war, brave doctors have stayed in the middle of dangerous areas to help the wounded. To get to the hospital, doctors must drive on unsafe roads because of guns and bombs. Once they arrive, they often care for the wounded whilst there is fighting outside. Sometimes, there are bombs and bullets that hit the hospital, so they have to try to protect the hospital building and patients.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Often, many badly injured patients arrive all at the same time when there is a lot of fighting. Sometimes there aren’t enough beds and the patients must be placed on the floor.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       In addition, doctors often have to manage with no medicine and very little medical equipment. There are also not enough doctors to help everyone, so sometimes doctors have to make a painful choice and pick which patient they help. For example, they may have to stop trying to save a dying child, so they can save somebody who has a good chance to live.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Whilst the doctors are caring for war victims, they are also taking care of patients with regular problems. But these clinics are only at night because it’s too dangerous for patients to walk there in the day.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Doctors are having trouble handling such terrible conditions. They have fears that they may be killed or injured, and they are very tired. There aren’t very many doctors, so most of them must work 20 hours in one day. They also suffer emotionally. They cannot forget seeing the terrible conditions of children in the hospital.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Why do these amazing doctors continue to help these patients? They believe that the world has forgotten these people, and they feel a responsibility to help them. They are heroes for their passion for helping people in a very dangerous place.

        Ludwig van Beethoven
       </b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       <br/>
       A) Ludwig van Beethoven was a German composer of classical music, who lived predominantly in Vienna, Austria. Beethoven is widely regarded as one of history’s supreme composers who produced notable works even after he completely lost his hearing. He was one of the greatest figures in the transitional period between the Classical and Romantic eras in music. His reputation has inspired and in many cases intimidated (吓倒) composers, musicians, and audiences coming after him.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       B) Beethoven’s first music teacher was his father, a musician at Bonn and an alcoholic who beat him and unsuccessfully attempted to exploit him as a child prodigy (天才) like Mozart. His mother died when he was 17, and for several years he was responsible for raising his two younger brothers. Beethoven moved to Vienna in 1792, where he intended to study with Joseph Haydn. He quickly established a reputation as an excellent pianist, and more slowly, as a composer. He settled into the career pattern he would follow for the remainder of his life.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       C) Beethoven’s career as a composer is usually divided into early, middle, and late periods. In the early period, he is seen as emulating (模仿) his great predecessors Haydn and Mozart, at the same time exploring new directions and gradually expanding the scope and ambition of his work. The middle period began shortly after Beethoven’s personal crisis centering around deafness. The period is noted for large-scale works expressing heroism and struggle; these include many of the most famous works of classical music. Beethoven’s late period began around 1816 and lasted until he died in 1827. His works in the late period are greatly admired for and characterized by their intellectual depth, intense and highly personal expression, and his experimentation with different forms.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       D) Beethoven’s personal life was troubled. Around age 26, he started to lose his hearing, which led him to contemplate suicide. He was attracted to unattainable women, whom he idealized. Some scholars believe his period of low productivity was caused by the depression resulting from Beethoven’s realization that he would never marry.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       E) Beethoven quarreled often bitterly with his relatives and others; he frequently treated other people badly. He moved often and had strange personal habits, such as wearing filthy (肮脏的) clothing even as he washed compulsively (强迫地). He often had financial troubles. Many listeners perceive an echo of Beethoven’s life in his music, which often depicts struggle followed by triumph. This description is often applied to Beethoven’s creation of masterpieces in the face of his severe personal difficulties.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       F) Beethoven was often in poor health, especially after his mid-20s, when he began to suffer from serious stomach pains. In 1826 his health took a drastic turn for the worse. His death the following year was attributed to a liver disease, but modern research on a lock of Beethoven’s hair taken at the time of his death, and a few pieces of his skull show that lead poisoning could well have contributed to his ill-health and ultimately to his death. The source of the lead poisoning may have been fish from the heavily polluted Danube River and lead compounds used to sweeten wines. It is unlikely that lead poisoning is the cause of his deafness, which several researchers think is caused by an autoimmune disorder. The hair analysis did not detect mercury (水银), which was consistent with the view that Beethoven did not have syphilis (梅毒), the disease that was commonly treated with mercury compounds at the time.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       G) Beethoven is viewed as one of the most important transitional figures between the Classical and Romantic eras of musical history. As far as musical form is concerned, he built on the principles of sonata form and development that he had inherited from Haydn and Mozart, but greatly extended them, writing longer and more ambitious movements.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       H) But Beethoven also radically redefined the symphony, transforming it from the rigidly structured four-ordered-movements form of Haydn’s era to a fairly open-ended form that could sustain as many movements as necessary, and of whatever form as necessary to give the work cohesion.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       I) Beethoven was much taken by the ideals of the Enlightenment and by the growing Romanticism in Europe. He initially dedicated his Third Symphony to Napoleon in the belief that the general would sustain the democratic and republican ideals of the French Revolution, but in 1804 he tore out the title page upon which he had written a dedication and renamed the symphony, as Napoleon’s imperial ambitions became clear.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       J) Continuing controversy surrounding Beethoven is whether he was a Romantic or a Classical composer. As documented elsewhere, since the meanings of the word “Romantic” and the definition of the period “Romanticism” both vary by discipline, Beethoven’s inclusion as a member of that movement or period must be looked at in context. If we consider the Romantic Movement as an aesthetic epoch in literature and the arts generally, Beethoven sits squarely in the first half along with literary Romantics such as the German poet Goethe and the English poet Percy Shelley. He was also called a Romantic by contemporaries such as E.T.A. Hoffmann. He is often considered the composer of the first song cycle and was influenced by Romantic folk idioms. He set dozens of such poems for voice, piano, and violin. If on the other hand we consider the context of musicology, where Romantic music is dated later, the matter is one of considerably greater debate. For some experts, Beethoven is not a Romantic, and his being one is a myth; for others he stands as a transitional figure, or an immediate precursor (先驱) to Romanticism, the inventor of the Romantic period; for others he is the prototypical Romantic composer, complete with myth of heroic genius and individuality.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       K) The marker buoy(浮标) of Romanticism has been pushed back and forth several times by scholars, and it remains a subject of intense debate, in no small part because Beethoven is seen as a pioneering figure. To those for whom the Enlightenment represents the basis of Modernity, he must therefore be a Classicist, while for those who see the romantic sensibility as a key to later aesthetics, he must be a Romantic.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       L) Listening to Beethoven’s music yields another possible scholarly analysis: There is definitely an evolution in style from Beethoven’s earliest compositions to his later works. The young Beethoven can be seen toiling to conform to the aesthetic models of his contemporaries: He wants to write music that is acceptable in the society of his days. Later, there is much more iconoclasm (打破旧习) in his approach where a symphony had until then only been a purely instrumental genre (类型). This means the question changes from “Whether Beethoven was a Classicist or a Romantic?” to “When was the pivotal moment that Beethoven tilted from dominant Classicism to dominant Romanticism?” Most scholars seem to concur: The presentation of the Fifth and Sixth Symphonies in a single concert in 1808 is probably closest to that pivotal point.

       When DR. THOMAS E. DEIKER, 59, remembers his life almost 30 years ago in Pineville, La., he thinks about guns. Worried that more of his neighbors appeared to be buying firearms, Deiker, a research psychologist at Central Louisiana State Hospital at the time, wrote a My Turn in 1974 advocating stricter gun-control laws at a time when any legislation that existed was loosely enforced.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Little progress on the issue of gun control has been made since his My Turn, Deiker says. “My judgment would be that from 1974 to now, there has been no change in gun-control laws at a national level”. What makes him angry is that even after the “long series of copycat (模仿犯罪的) high-school shootings” and “a long series of dissatisfied employees walking into their places of business and killing large numbers of people”, there has still been little action taken. “There was some debate and discussion, but nothing ultimately happened to improve the gun-control laws.”
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       In fact, weapons today are more deadly. “We have shifted clearly to a far more dangerous and lethal form of firearms in the United States,” he says, “with the widespread use of automatic and semiautomatic weapons, the Internet has proven a perfect provider, offering information on how to build these weapons and where to purchase them.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Many of those buyers, Deiker worries, are hardly older than children. The amount of graphic (图像的) violence youth are exposed to today desensitizes (使麻木) them to violence, he says. “How many thousands of killings will the average child view, either in cartoon form or in actual graphic form, on TV and in videogames?” he asks. “Children grow up practicing. They’re desensitized to the experience of violence in graphic detail. And they have skills in weaponry use from practicing videogames, in which you actually have something you hold in your hand that you can point and shoot.”
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       In 1974, Deiker wrote that the vast majority of killings are committed by people known intimately to each other. In 2002, “That is still the case,” he says. And Deiker is not optimistic about change: “If we impose total gun control from this day forward, social scientists predict we would be years away from seeing any effect.”

      <p style="text-align:justify">
       A generation after Americans lost the habit of knowing who their space heroes really are, the Columbia astronauts were remembered Tuesday as awe-struck (肃然起敬的) youngsters who longed to “reach the stars”, and as fun-loving but dedicated adults who never lost their sense of adventure. President Bush and first lady Laura Bush attended a 45-minute memorial ceremony at the Johnson Space Center.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       The president and the chief of the astronaut corps helped bring the adventurous lives of the seven Columbia astronauts who died Saturday into focus for NASA employees and the nation. Navy Capt. Kent Rominger, the astronaut corps chief, remembered the crew as a ''generous and caring bunch with a great sense of humor''.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Bush also eulogized each astronaut. He spoke on a breezy, clear day as thousands of space program workers stood around a tree-lined pond. The televised ceremony was also broadcast for workers at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. ''Their mission was almost complete, and we lost them so close to home,'' Bush said. ''Their loss was sudden and terrible. And for their families, the grief is heavy. Our nation shares in your sorrow and your pride. And today we remember not only one moment of tragedy but seven lives of great purpose and achievement.'' Bush declared that the United States would continue its manned space program: ''This cause of exploration and discovery is not an option we choose. It is a desire written in the human heart.''
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Bush was accompanied to Houston on Air Force One with former senator John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth, and Neil Armstrong, the first man to set foot on the moon. The president arrived at the ceremony walking hand-in-hand with the first lady. Afterward, they met privately with about 40 family members. A White House assistant said Bush spoke to each person. He made small talk with the children about school and offered his regrets for meeting at such a tragic time. He told one widow, ‘‘you're a strong soul.'' He said to one father who lost a child, ‘‘we're so proud of you as a father. ''
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       The roar of NASA T-38 training jets that flew a ''missing man'' formation still echoed in the distance, as space agency workers leaving the ceremony said they had found comfort in the service.

       My Neighbor has a gun. In fact, not having the good fortune to live in the last house on a dead-end street, I am surrounded by neighbors with guns. My situation is hardly novel, since most American households own at least one weapon. We now have enough privately owned guns to arm nearly every man, woman and child in the country. And some of those children are not just imaginary gun users, as recent statistics indicate.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       My neighbors’ guns make me nervous; I’m afraid that they might go off at the wrong time, pointed in the wrong direction. I’ve asked why such dangerous items are allowed to clutter up the house. I’ve gotten several answers, from constitutional rights to the innocent sport of blasting birds out of the skies. I’d like to focus on just one of these reasons.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       My neighbor tells me that curling up at night with his gun nearby makes him feel safer. Safer from what? A madman out to better the going entry in the “Guinness Book of World Records” for bloody brutality? My neighbor faces far less danger from the mentally ill killer, who fortunately is extremely rare, than he does from my other neighbor who also has a gun. Contrary to the public myth, mental patients have crime rates far below those of my neighbor or me; for all categories of crime and for homicide in particular. One of the few safe places left to live in this gun-packing country is on the grounds of your local mental hospital, where the residents are far less aggressive than my neighbor and guns are checked in at the gate.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Safer from some intruder (侵入者) in the night seeking to deprive his wife of her virtue or him of his new color television? According to best available estimates, my neighbor’s odds of doing himself in accidentally with his own gun are about five times higher than his odds of being done in by some intruder. As a gun owner, my neighbor would be better advised to invest his money in locks and a loud dog. Actually, the intruder in the night accounts for fewer than three percent of our gun deaths. The bulk comes from perfectly law-abiding (守法的) but gun-toting (持枪的) people like my neighbors, who kill each other, themselves, or me.
