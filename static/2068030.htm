                                <p style="text-align: justify;">W: I didn’t realize Thanksgiving was such an important holiday for you.</p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">M: Oh, it’s the biggest day of the year for my family! Everyone at our parents’ home: my two sisters, my brother, all our families – it’s at least 23 people — More than 30 if aunts and uncles come over!</p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">W: Wow, sounds like a lot of people for one house!</p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">M: Yea, but we love it! We move all the furniture out of the big living room and set up four long tables so we can all eat together.</p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">W: Must be quite a wonderful dinner! Is it all the classics?</p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">M: You bet! We have two whole turkeys, and 10 pounds of sweet potatoes! Not to mention heaps of mom’s famous fruit salad. Aunt Peggy brings three meat pies and Uncle Charlie brings three apple pies.</p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">W: Haha, that’s so traditional! You guys are like the original Americans two hundred years ago!</p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">M: What do you do, if it’s not “so traditional?”</p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">W: Thanksgiving is never big for my family. My parents live in Florida on the other side of the country, so, my sister, her husband and I all go out to eat. We try a new restaurant every year. Last year was Greek – this
                                    year we’re trying Mexican food!</p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">M: Um … okay – but don’t you miss the turkey and the pie?</p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">W: Not really. I do sometimes miss the pie … So, the last few years I’ve baked an apple pie – and after dinner the three go back to my place and have apple pie with ice cream.</p><br /> New words:
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">Turkey n. 火鸡</p>
                                <p><br/>

                                    <p>What preparation will the man’s family make for Thanksgiving?</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;">M: It’s Earth Day in three weeks. Every club needs an activity to encourage awareness of environmental issues. With green recycling bins all over campus, a recycling drive can raise awareness, reminding people to recycle
                                    all year long. As President of the Recycling Club at the University of Colorado, what do think?</p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">W: Great idea! But let’s not print out hundreds of small posters and waste paper!</p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">M: Agreed! Three large posters with our Recycle: It’s Cool! Slogan, one in the Science Building, one in the Student Union and one outside the Student Union.</p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">W: Great! So remember the wildflowers we planted that are blooming now outside the Student Union? I asked Dean Johnson for permission to put our Recycle: It’s Cool! poster there and to take photos of students, standing
                                    with the wildflowers next to the sign.</p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">M: Okay … Keep going …</p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">W: I was thinking we could have a professional photographer take people’s pictures standing with the wildflowers – next to the Recycle: It’s Cool! Poster.</p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">M: Okay … I’m loving this…</p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">W: Then the students go to our Recycling website the next day to get their photos off our website. That way they have a cool picture with the wildflowers AND our Recycle: It’s Cool! poster that reminds them to keep recycling
                                    long after Earth Day has passed!</p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">M: I love how your mind works! That’s like a triangle – three times reminding people to recycle! First, take a picture with the wildflowers next to the Recycle: It’s Cool! Poster. Second, visit our Recycling website to
                                    get the picture. Finally, view the picture and see the Recycling sign again and again!</p>

                                <div style="text-align:justify">Some of the most promising cities and towns have now turned into neglected wastelands that breed criminals and diseases. This phenomenon is referred to as urban decay. Urban decay, in simpler terms, is the gradual falling
                                    apart of a previously functional city or town. Urban decay was mostly associated with regions in Eastern Europe, North America, and parts of the British Isles. However, over the years, almost every country in the world
                                    has faced the problem of urban decay.<br />
                                    <br /> Urban decay has no single cause, but is a result of complicated social and economic conditions. Urban decay may be caused by deindustrialization, economic breakdown, and failure of businesses, which in turn leads
                                    to increasing crime rates, growing unemployment, and rising poverty in the area. Another important reason for urban decay is the development, both economic and social, of some other nearby areas, to which the population
                                    has migrated for better opportunities.<br />
                                    <br /> Governments of many countries around the world have recognized the curse of urban decay and have taken active steps to bring the dead areas of the cities back to life. In addition to this, steps are being taken
                                    to control the decrease of population and maintain a stable economic and social atmosphere for every individual. In order to save our cities from urban decay, we need to take care of not only our homes but also the
                                    world outside. This will ensure that the city, which might be slowly rotting away, is saved from decaying and a stable economic and social future is maintained for everyone.</div>

                                <div style="text-align:justify">In a country where, in some places, a sandwich barely costs a dollar while a bag of baby carrots is priced nearly three times as much, there’s plenty of work to be done to make healthy foods affordable and accessible. There
                                    is no denying that food insecurity, especially cheap and junk food is a great concern in the US. In fact, according to the US Department of Agriculture nearly 14.5 percent of Americans experienced food insecurity at
                                    some point in 2010.<br />
                                    <br /> To fight this, many cities across the US are assessing their food production potential and creating special laws for promoting urban agriculture. Let me clarify that “urban” agriculture does not imply tearing
                                    down high-density buildings in the city centers to build farms. As an urban planner I am a supporter of higher densities. However, the land around the cities or the residential open spaces with no other obvious use
                                    could be used as productive land within the cities.<br />
                                    <br /> In the US, urban agriculture began at the grassroots level as a social justice movement to fight food insecurity among under-privileged communities. Within a couple of decades, a growing demand resulted in local
                                    governments making an active effort to support urban agriculture.<br />
                                    <br /> Urban agriculture is not just about food security: it does great service to the cause of sustainable cities. For grocery stores, purchasing fresh and locally grown produce reduces energy needs and costs associated
                                    with long distance travel and refrigeration. City residents also benefit from cleaner air and cooler temperatures in summer. Also, urban agriculture provides a great opportunity to make use of unused land and water
                                    resources for food cultivation.</div>

                                    during those seven years she had a number of jobs, including one job as an English teacher in Portugal.<br />
                                    <br /> Rowling <b>36) </b> <span type="text" class="blankinput">submitted</span> the book to four publishers before one of them bought it. She was very happy to sell her book because it was her life’s dream to be a
                                    published writer. Before she sold her book, Rowling was financially <b>37) </b> <span type="text" class="blankinput">crippled</span>, living in a small apartment with her daughter without heat in the winter.<br />
                                    <br /> Harry Potter became very successful with children and adults in England since it satisfied their <b>38) </b> <span type="text" class="blankinput">appetites</span>. The book also became very popular overseas.
                                    For example, once it came to the United States, it was immediately <b>39) </b> <span type="text" class="blankinput">surrounded</span> by many crazy readers. Her second and third books <b>40) </b> <span type="text" class="blankinput">echoed</span>                                    this popularity as well. The three books soon filled the top three places on many newspapers’ <b>41) </b> <span type="text" class="blankinput">catalog</span> of best-sellers. Then the books were made into movies, which
                                    were undoubtedly in <b>42) </b> <span type="text" class="blankinput">ongoing</span> demand. Rowling’s life had changed significantly, in just three years.<br />
                                    <br /> Not being <b>43) </b> <span type="text" class="blankinput">hindered</span>, Harry Potter soon sold more than 30 million books around the world and was translated into more than thirty-five languages. In 1997,
                                    she earned £70 a week. By the end of 2001, her <b>44) </b> <span type="text" class="blankinput">legal</span> income had mounted over £150 million, making her one of the most successful female writers of all time.</p>

                                <div style="text-align:center"><b>Does Inequality Help Growth or Hurt It?</b></div>
                                <div style="text-align:justify"><br /> A) One of the most urgent questions in economics today is the connection between inequality and growth. That is because one of the big economic facts of our time is the surge in income disparity, particularly between
                                    those at the very top and everyone else. The other big fact is the recession set off by the financial crisis and the consequent imperative to jump-start economic growth. Figuring out the relationship between these two
                                    issues is therefore a good way that economists are spending their time on it.<br />
                                    <br /> B) There are two main and contradictory ideas about how that relationship might work. One is that inequality is the price of healthy economic growth. If the private sector is thriving, the most successful capitalists
                                    will be getting very rich. Creating a system that allows – indeed, encourages – the best and the brightest to pull away from everyone else is how you shift your economy into its highest gear. In this view, rising income
                                    inequality is not a symptom of a fast-growing economy or a motivation that will help create one. Instead, too much inequality crushes economic growth.<br />
                                    <br /> C) There is, however, another theory, and it has been winning adherents (拥护者) after the financial crisis. There are different arguments for why that might happen. One is that high income inequality creates an
                                    unstable system that is sensitive to costly booms and depressions. Another is that when too much of the income goes to the very top and not enough goes to the middle, spending declines, putting a brake on growth.<br
                                    />
                                    <br /> D) David Howell, a professor of economics at The New School in New York, has written a draft paper for the Center for American Progress, a progressive research group that investigates the first argument. Howell
                                    argues that the United States and Britain have acted over the past three decades on what he calls the laissez-faire (放任自由) theory, that the equation of rising inequality and increasing gross domestic product is correct.
                                    As Howell puts it, “the laissez-faire case for high inequality is grounded in the belief that growth in output and employment depends mainly on strong motivations to work and invest.” Howell tested that view by comparing
                                    the United States and Britain to their peers. He asked whether “compared to other rich countries, US income inequality has paid off in relatively high growth.” His answer: not particularly. He finds that “there is no
                                    simple correlation between our measures of growth and income inequality.”<br />
                                    <br /> E) That may come as a surprise to many Americans, who are accustomed to hearing, as Howell explained, “that the US middle class is doing relatively well, at least compared to Europe, because of productivity growth
                                    and because we allow higher inequality.” But the reality is that at least some of those so-called hardened European economies, dragged down by their highly redistributive welfare states, have outperformed the United
                                    States. “What we see is Sweden having really good productivity growth by all measures, despite much more modest increases in inequality and starting at a much lower level,” he said. “The US is anywhere from an OK to
                                    middling performer in the Age of Inequality,” Howell said, using his term for our era. But while his work suggests inequality is not needed to get growth, he does not show that inequality actually hurts growth either:
                                    “I don’t show a strong measurable reverse effect.”<br />
                                    <br /> F) Lars Osberg, an economist at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada, takes on this second argument – the case that inequality, at least beyond a certain point, can kill growth. He, too, adopts a comparative
                                    lens, looking at Canada, the United States and Mexico. Osberg argues that a growing chasm (巨大差距) between those at the very top and everyone else endangers the overall economy. His worry is financial instability. “The
                                    added savings of the increasingly wealthy people must be loaned to balance total current expenditure,” he writes, “but increasing indebtedness implies financial fragility, periodic financial crises, greater unpredictability
                                    of total income and, as governments respond to mass unemployment with countercyclical fiscal policies (反周期波动的财政政策), a compounding instability of public finances.”<br />
                                    <br /> G) This is a variation of an argument by Raghuram Rajan, a politically center-right professor at the University of Chicago, who has suggested that rising income inequality was one of the drivers of the financial
                                    crisis. As income inequality increased, and the incomes of the middle class stagnated (停滞), the US government responded by increasing the consumer credit available to the middle class.<br />
                                    <br /> H) Both Howell and Osberg are skeptical, at best, of the value of rising income inequality as a driver of economic growth. When you put that conclusion together with the arithmetic of democracy – rising income
                                    inequality means a majority of voters are on the losing end of the deal – a political backlash (强烈的反响) seems inevitable.<br />
                                    <br /> I) “Go back to the 1920s or the 1870s and economists were worried about the stability of the capitalist system,” Osberg said. “One of the things the 1930s experience teaches us is there are some disastrous outcomes
                                    which can happen.” The investing class and the academic world are focused on those dangers. “Can capitalism survive?” is one of the trendiest conference topics among red-blooded capitalists and left-leaning professors
                                    alike. So far, at the ballot box and on the street, this question has not been as obvious. That does not mean it will not be in the future – and in ways we cannot predict.</div>

                                <p style="text-align:justify">Oil is essential for modern life. About 64 percent of the world’s oil is located in the Middle East. The problem lies in getting the oil from the countries that produce it to the countries that consume it. This is mainly
                                    done using oil tankers. There are roughly 4,000 oil tankers in use today, and every day more than 100 million tons of oil is shipped. Usually this oil is shipped safely and with no problems, but occasionally there is
                                    a disaster.<br />
                                    <br /> Every year millions of tons of oil are spilled into the ocean. This spilled oil can have terrible effects on ocean life, including the coastlines where the oil washes up onto shore. Some of the largest spills
                                    in history have been caused by oil tankers running into each other or by an oil tanker running onto the rocks in water. After these spills, officials try to discover who or what was at fault to help prevent similar
                                    accidents in the future.<br />
                                    <br /> One of the worst oil spills in history occurred along the Alaskan coastline in 1989, when the tanker stuck on the coast of Alaska, spilling 42 million liters of oil. Although it wasn’t the largest oil spill of
                                    all time, the disaster was terrible because it occurred in such a sensitive natural area. In this spill, the tanker’s captain, who was tired from overwork and drinking alcohol, had gone to take a rest. He gave control
                                    of the ship to another sailor, who was unfamiliar with the route the ship was taking.<br />
                                    <br /> Unfortunately, the ship ran onto a natural underwater rock wall near the Alaskan coast. Damaged by the rock, the ship leaked oil out into the ocean. More than 1,600 kilometers of coastline were affected by the
                                    oil spill. Some scientists who studied nature in the area estimate that 580,000 birds and 5,500 otters died as a result of the oil from the spill covering their skin. Smaller shellfish and other sea creatures living
                                    on the ocean floor were also affected, and these creatures were later eaten by seals, whales, and other animals.</p>
