Meanwhile, I’m reading every day and taking thousands of mini-vacations in my imagination!

       W: That’s right George, and I can’t wait for my two weeks of vacation. I’ve been dreaming of seeing London since I was eight years old when I saw Queen Elizabeth on television! I’m going all over London! I’m planning to take London buses and to use the British underground which they call “The Tube”.

       M: Wow! But why go in November when it’s so cold and rainy?
      </p>

       M: Speaking of attractions, what will you see?

      </p>

       M: That sounds fun!

       For most of us, travel is a limited experience. Our trips may be long, but they always have a Point A and a Point B: a beginning and an end. Most of us return home; some people move to a new home; but we always arrive home.

       Not Andy. Thanks to the success of his two websites, Andy has been able to travel for over a decade, making his way through 77 countries across the globe. A little while ago, I asked Andy to share his story. “I was bored with the life in the United States. I had a successful business. I was making good money, had a boat, two houses. But I was bored. I wasn’t married. Then one day I just took off. ”

       “When I first left, I went down to Mexico for a one-year leave. I wanted to see if I could earn money from the Internet. At the time, the Internet was developing. So I decided to take a leave, move down to Mexico, and work eight hours a day trying to make enough money off it. At first I didn’t plan to travel forever, but my websites started to make money. The first amount of money I made was $5. I talked to myself: ‘I don’t ever want to go home again.’ You have to be able to have income no matter where you are on earth.”

       “I once met a German guy, who said to me: ‘After being gone this long, you’re going to have trouble to stop.’ I never forgot it. Yeah, for the first two years I was still thinking I’d go back. But I decided almost eight years ago that I didn’t want a home.”

       Being the first person ever to set foot on the moon, Neil Armstrong’s sentence “That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind” has been written into history. The moon landing of the Apollo 11 was watched by the largest television audience of its time, and President Nixon put in a phone call just after the US flag was planted on the moon. On the astronauts’ return, NASA sent them on a world tour.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Though he was very excited about landing on the moon, Neil Armstrong didn’t like being the center of the attention and preferred to talk about the facts rather than feelings. He started to decline speeches and interviews, eventually refusing to sign autographs and keeping away from being photographed in public. In fact, Armstrong had done only two television interviews in the last 40 years, and he had said nothing about what he felt about anything. Andrew Smith, a writer who has met many famous people, has been repeatedly refused an interview with Armstrong despite many requests, although the pair has had email correspondence. So what has made Neil Armstrong such a reluctant hero? The reason is simple: He believed that he wasn’t worthy of the attention. There were 400,000 people that worked on the moon landing program in various different ways and he thought he shouldn’t get all the credit just because he did the flying part. Armstrong didn’t want to gain financially, even though a lot of the other moon walkers have done this. It was said that if Armstrong spent just one afternoon signing autographs he could make a million dollars, but he had always refused.

        A Parents’ Guide to UCAS Applications
       </b>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align:justify">
       <br/>
       A) To support your child through the UCAS (Universities and Colleges Admissions Service) process, you’ll need to be aware of the key dates and — make sure that they are, too. “The university application process is a minefield,” says Wendy Pannell, whose daughter is in year 13. It can be particularly confusing for parents who want to be supportive, but who have no previous experience of the university admissions service. “University has changed enormously,” says Andrew Swarbrick, university applications coordinator at the independent Abingdon school, Oxfordshire. “Parents need to remember that it’s different from how it was for them. They need to start with a blank slate.” With that in mind, here’s how you can help your sixth-former to find and apply to a university that’s right for them.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       B) Most schools will host information days that help parents to prepare. “Go to those sessions if a school is running them,” says Nancy Raynsford, whose daughter is in her first year at Liverpool University. Students should think about where they want to go and what they want to study in year 12, as the application procedure will get underway in the autumn term of year 13. But with 37,000 courses to choose from at over 300 institutions, how can you help them to narrow down the options?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       C) If your sixth-former has a dream career in mind, such as medicine or dentistry, they’ll need a specific degree to achieve it. If they don’t know, admissions tutors advise students to apply for a subject they enjoy or a course they are fascinated by. Make use of the resources available online, such as university league tables and prospectuses（简章）.”I found the UCAS website a mine of information,” says Wendy Pannell. “It’s got all the deadline dates and everything in one place. You can also download apps and use Twitter — I’ve followed UCAS and universities.”
       <br/>
       <br/>
       D) Parents and sixth-formers should go to open days to get a feel for what a university is like. “We went to about 20 open days,” says Nancy Raynsford. “We sat in lectures and that helped us to understand what it was all about. I was designated as the note-taker so that my daughter could listen. I didn’t ask any questions publicly because that was her job, but my being there gave her confidence. We could talk about it afterwards, and the shared experience of having been there with her meant that we could understand the process as well.” “I went on a couple of visits to universities,” says Barbara Asante, whose daughter is now at Sussex University. “It’s important for the parents to go because you know your child and so you can see that a university or a course will suit them.”
       <br/>
       <br/>
       E) Parents should know important dates in the UCAS calendar and remind their sixth-former of them. All applications are made through UCAS and the final deadline for the majority of courses is January 15. However, most applications are submitted during the autumn term of year 13. It’s recommended that students complete applications as early as possible; although universities must consider every one received by the deadline, many make offers in the autumn.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       F) Students can apply for up to five courses. Entry for most courses will be determined by predicted A-level results and tariff points. A certain number of tariff points are given for each A-level grade. You can look at tariff tables online to see how many points each grade has. Many schools advise that students have at least one “back-up” option, with lower entry requirements, in case they do not get their predicted grades.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       G) As well as understanding and guiding your child through the application process, parents can help with the personal statement, which is a chance for students to show their passion for a subject. “Parents can help their son or daughter to begin their personal statement,” says Swarbrick. “Get them to explain what they find interesting and exciting about their subject,” he says, “as well as to say what they’ve done to demonstrate that interest. However, it’s also important that parents recognize that their son or daughter has to write their personal statement themselves.”
       <br/>
       <br/>
       H) Parents can also help by being aware of the early deadline. The deadline for Oxbridge and some specific courses, such as medicine and dentistry, is October 15. If your sixth-former is thinking about applying to any of these subjects or universities they should prepare well in advance. Students may need to take a test or submit written work. They are then shortlisted and could be invited for an interview.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I) At the offer stage, parents should play a monitorial role. Offers are staggered（犹豫，动摇）depending on when an application was made. Offers can be “unconditional” or “conditional” – which means they depend on A-level results. Students have to decline or accept only when all of their five choices have got back to them. They will then have to respond by a set deadline, given by UCAS. If a student’s first choice is a conditional offer, they can also accept a second insurance choice, which asks for lower grades. “At this stage, parents should ask sixth-formers what the deadline is and when they plan to make their response by, to make sure that they are on top of the procedure. As the whole thing becomes more real, parents could help to organize another visit or two so that they get a second impression.”
       <br/>
       <br/>
       J) If your sixth-former did not get into any of their choices, then they can still find a course through UCAS Extra, which stays open until early July. They can use the course search to find out which courses still have places available and apply through UCAS. Another option is to go through clearing, which matches students with unfilled places on courses. It’s organized by UCAS and opens at 5 p.m. on A-level results day, August 15. It then runs until September. Encourage your child to keep calm, as clearing can be a stressful process. Expect them to be on the phone, contacting universities. Institutions say they prefer students, rather than parents, to call, so it’s best for parents to take a step back and to let their son or daughter speak for themselves.

       Worldwide, 40 million new passenger cars are built every year. A recent survey estimates that the number of cars will triple over the next 20 years. Most of this growth will take place in China. In comparison, the United States has been completely transformed by cars.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Cars did not become necessities for families in the United States until after World War II. Prior to that time, cars were seen mainly as toys for the rich. By the end of the war, however, people were tired of saving their money. They were ready to have some fun. Unlike Europe and Japan, whose industries had been wiped out by World War II, factories in the United States could quickly be changed from production of wartime items to mass production of such luxury items as cars.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       As cars grew in popularity in the United States, there were also changes in lifestyle. Farmers who were once isolated from society by rural life now took weekend trips into the city. Also, workers in the cities no longer needed to live in inner-city housing in order to keep their jobs at nearby factories. Those who made enough money moved out of the cities and into the suburbs. Now that each family had its own car, going to work from the suburbs became a common practice.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Cars not only changed the way people lived, but also changed the way they thought. Traditionally, because young people spent most of their time outside school in and around the home, the strongest role models for teenagers were their parents. However, once they had access to their own cars, teens began spending more time out with friends. Therefore, they became less likely to follow the behavior of their parents and more likely to follow their friends’.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       One thing producers paid little attention to, however, was safety. It wasn’t until the mid-1960s that consumers began to demand that all car companies include at least a few common safety features in new cars. These new standards eventually led to safety features such as seat belts, air bags, anti-lock brakes, and automatic door locks.
