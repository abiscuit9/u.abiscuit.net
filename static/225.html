       Learning a foreign language can increase the size of your brain. This is what scientists learned when they looked at the brains of people learning foreign languages. Some young adults studied foreign languages, while a different group also studied hard, but not at languages. Results showed that the brains of the language students grew, but the brains of the other group remained unchanged. This adds to the good news about language study.
       <br/>
       <!--[if-->
       <br/>
       We also know that people who speak more than one language have better memories and are more creative and mentally adjustable than people who speak only one language. These benefits are still true for people who learn a foreign language when they become adults. Edinburgh University researchers point out that millions of people across the world learn their foreign language later in life. Their results show that knowing another language is an advantage, and it doesn’t matter when you learn it.

       Erica Carlisle has recently returned from a year teaching English abroad, and she has some advice to share about some of the more difficult parts of learning a second language. “Sometimes you need to make some embarrassing mistakes to learn a language,” she says. “One reason children learn languages so quickly is because they have no fear of embarrassment. Unfortunately, however, adults do.”
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Erica’s favourite examples are some of the funny mispronunciations that language students do by accident. For example, the sounds of the letters ‘b’ and ‘p’ are very similar, but they make a big difference between “Big Ben” and “pig pen”. One time her student said that he visited “pig pen” in London and everybody laughed. Her advice to students is to be humble and to be brave at the same time when they speak, but most of all, to learn to laugh when they make a mistake.

      <div style="text-align:justify">
       There’s a mysterious person who’s giving people money. For two years, somebody has been leaving $100 bills in unusual places. Some people have found $100 bill inside pockets of clothes, inside pots or with boxes of food at the supermarket.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       When people realize the money is real, many of them cry because the money would help their financial situation. One woman said she found the money when her family was having a difficult time, so she appreciated the thoughtful action of someone she didn’t know.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Some people have done wonderful things with the money they found. One boy found $100 in a toy store, so he bought a lot of toys. But not for him. He bought toys for a children’s group who helps low-income families.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       People believe that at least $55,000 has been found, but they don’t know who this generous person is and may never know why he or she has been doing this.

       Chris King is happy about his two hands though they aren’t really his. A few years ago, Chris had an accident whilst at work and lost both of his hands.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Recently he had an operation to receive two new hands from someone who gave away his hands after he died. Chris is the UK’s second person to have an operation to replace a hand, but he is the first to receive two hands.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       His doctors say that the operation was difficult because usually most hands are completely replaced. However, in this case, Chris still had part of his hands, including his fingers, which made it very complicated and challenging. The operation was successful and Chris can already move his hands after only a few days.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Chris says the hands fit perfectly and he can’t wait to hold a beer, work in his garden and ride his bicycle. Also, Chris says that he is happy that he can now wear proper clothes with buttons.

       All of us probably buy things that we don’t need or don’t end up using. We feel a little upset that we wasted our money buying something we will never use, and sometimes we just give it to someone else or throw it away. But we usually don’t do this very often.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There are other people who buy things that they don’t need, or sometimes they find them in other people’s trash and bring them home. However, in contrast to most of us, these people never throw anything away. This type of behavior is called hoarding, and the people that do it are called hoarders.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hoarders like to shop. They go to stores very frequently to buy things that catch their eye. Sometimes it can be a collection of things they like. For example, a hoarder who likes clocks may look specifically for clocks and buy them even if he already has hundreds of clocks in his home. It may seem like this is a harmless behavior, but it isn’t.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hoarders often live in dangerous situations because their homes are so full of things that they can’t even walk around inside. They must climb over boxes of all the things that they have bought or found because they have no place to put everything. The house is unsafe and often very dirty.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hoarders are not rich people who have the money to buy everything. Usually, they are very poor because they spend so much money on things they don’t need. They also don’t realize that they have a problem. They believe that it’s OK to buy and fill their homes with things.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Sadly, many hoarders don’t listen to their families who try to help them clean their homes. Then city officials will force the hoarders to move out of their homes because they aren’t safe, and they lose everything.

       At the age of 14, most teenagers are thinking about friends, school, sports, and having fun in general. Jerika is thinking about dying. She isn’t sad about it; she’s ready for it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Since she was a baby, Jerika has had a serious medical problem that makes her body weak. Her brain can’t send messages for her body to move, so her body doesn’t really work anymore. She can move her hands and legs a little, but she has a hard time just holding her head up straight. She spends her days in an electric chair to move around and nights in her bed.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jerika will die soon, but she can’t bear the great pain anymore. She doesn’t want a machine to breathe for her, so in a few months, she will stop using the breathing machine and let her body decide when it is time to die. Now, Jerika is enjoying her last months of life. She’s had a large party with her friends and family and spent time dancing and laughing. They made her queen of the party. Her mother said Jerika has always been a happy girl and feels peaceful about Jerika’s decision.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Many people have wondered if a 14-year-old girl is able to make such a serious decision about her life. Jerika’s doctors have said that she is more mature and wise than most people think. The doctors also say that Jerika and her mother have done everything they could to improve the quality of Jerika’s life, and they honor her wish.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jerika thinks her story will be an important message about her disease and hopes her experience will bring attention to the disease and help find a cure to it.

       M:  Did you hear the local news today?
       <br/>
       W:  No, I’ve been in my room all day studying. Why? What’s going on?
       <br/>
       M:  There was a big accident between a double-decker bus and a black cab near Victoria Station.
       <br/>
       W:  Was it bad?
       <br/>
       M:  It was pretty serious. I believe 15 people were taken to hospital and many were seriously injured.
       <br/>
       W:  That sounds terrible! Do they know what caused the accident?
       <br/>
       M:  Well, you know how horrible the traffic is around that area.
       <br/>
       W:  Yes, it’s one of the worst in the city.
       <br/>
       M:  It was particularly terrible this morning, so the cab driver was in a hurry to get to his destination. The driver was racing around all the buses, and suddenly a double- decker bus was directly in his path.
       <br/>
       W:  So what happened next?
       <br/>
       M:  The cab driver couldn’t stop in time, so the cab hit the bus with great force.
       <br/>
       W:  Because he was driving fast?
       <br/>
       M:  Yes, as I mentioned before, the cab driver was in a hurry, so he was driving much faster than he should’ve been.
       <br/>
       W:  How did so many people get injured?
       <br/>
       M:  After the cab hit the bus, the bus was pushed into a shop.
       <br/>
       W:  Oh, that’s awful! Were there people in the shop?
       <br/>
       M:  Yes, that’s where the majority of the people were injured. Many of the shoppers were struck by the bus, and some of them were hit by falling pieces of the building.
       <br/>
       W:  What about the people in the cab? What happened to them?
       <br/>
       M:  Surprisingly, they were not hurt at all, but they were shocked at what had happened. The driver and passenger were very sorry for causing the accident because they were impatient.
       <br/>
       W:  That’s true. It’s better to plan ahead and drive safely than to be late and drive irresponsibly.

       What are baseball fans? Baseball fans wear their official team T-shirts and jackets everywhere, sometimes even to work. Then, whenever the team offers a free item, the fans rush to get it. In addition, baseball fans cover the walls of their rooms with their favorite players’ pictures. When they go to a game, which they do as often as possible, the true baseball fans put on their team colors, grab their team flags, pin on their team buttons. At the game, these fans form a section, constantly encouraging their favorite players and enthusiastically responding to every cheer flashed on the electronic scoreboard.

       Baseball fans, in addition to behaving crazily, are also extremely interested in things of small importance. Every day, they turn to the sports page of the newspaper and study last night’s statistics. Their bookshelves are full of books and newspapers with information of their team. They delight in remembering such unimportant facts as who is left-handed and what food their favorite player likes.

       to the team of their choice. This strong loyalty makes fans dangerous, for anyone who dares to say to a loyal fan that some other team is better could be risking physical damage. Incidents of violence on the baseball field have increased in recent years and are a matter of growing concern.

       From mid-October through March, baseball fans are like any other human beings. They pay their taxes, take out the garbage, and complain about the high cost of living or the latest home repair. But when April comes, the colors and radios go on, the record books come off the shelves, and the devotion returns. For the true baseball fan, another season of craziness has begun.

      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Anger is a normal emotion that we all feel from time to time. Some people express anger openly in a calm reasonable way. Some explode with anger, and scream and shout. But other people keep their anger inside. They can not or will not express it. This is called repressing anger.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Many doctors think that repressing anger is more dangerous to a person’s health than expressing it. They say that when a person is angry, the brain gives out the same hormones (荷尔蒙) as that are produced during tense and nervous situations. They speed the heart rate and raise blood pressure, so the person feels excited and ready to act. Repressing these feelings will only make the feelings continue, and this can lead to many medical problems. To prevent these problems, these doctors suggest letting the anger out by expressing it freely. But recently some other doctors question this. They say that people who express anger repeatedly and violently become, in fact, more but not less angry. And this could cause medical problems.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       However, some doctors say that both repressing and expressing anger can be dangerous. They believe that those who express anger strongly may be more likely to develop heart diseases, and that those who keep their anger inside may face a greater danger of high blood pressure.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Doctors say the solution is to learn how to deal with anger. The first step is to admit that you are angry and to recognize the real cause of the anger, and then to decide if the cause is serious enough to get angry about. If it is, do not express your anger while angry. Wait until your anger has cooled down, and express yourself calmly and reasonably. Doctors also say that a good way to deal with anger is to find humor in the situation that has made you angry, for laughter is much healthier than anger.

       School buildings themselves can show liberal (开明的) or conservative views about what should go on in a classroom. The earliest schools had separate classrooms for different grades. The rooms were laid out formally, with pupils’ desks fastened to the floor in straight rows facing the teacher’s desk. Clearly, such schools reflected a teacher-and-subject-centered view of education.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Schools of the next generation had more open space, and most had movable desks. They also often provided special rooms or areas for science, art, music, and physical education. There were still separate rooms for different grade levels, however, and the desks still were likely to be formally arranged. That is, the schoolroom was still largely designed to carry out the old-school program, which involved grade levels, uniform time blocks, and study of subject matters. Newer subjects, not newer teaching methods, accounted for most of what was new in school design.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       The first school buildings constructed to encourage liberal teaching methods appeared in the mid-1950s. Folding interior (内部的) walls permitted the flexible use of space to encourage large-group, small-group, or individual instruction. Some provided
       <b>
        carrels
       </b>
       for individual study, areas for team teaching, and centers for programmed instruction.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       In the newest buildings called open schools, the use of space is even more flexible. Areas within the buildings can be readily expanded for program changes, and used for many kinds of functions. One should remember, though, the physical layout (布局) of a school cannot decide whether it has the conservative or liberal teaching practices. What determines whether the classroom is liberal or conservative is the spirit and attitude of the teacher.

       Everybody lies. It may only be “white lies”, but everyone tells lies or “omits the truth” sometimes. People start lying at around age 4 to 5 when children gain an awareness of the use and power of language. This first lying is not ill-natured, but rather to find out, or test, what can be controlled in a child’s environment. Eventually children begin to use lying to get out of trouble or get something they want. White lies, those told to protect someone’s feelings, are not a big deal at all. The person, however, who seems to feel forced to lie about both small and large stuff, has a problem. They lie to protect themselves, look good, gain financially or socially and avoid punishment. A much more troubling group is those who lie a lot, and knowingly, for personal gain. Lying often gets worse with the passage of time. When you get away with a lie, it often forces you to continue your lies.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
       Why do we dislike liars so much? It’s a matter of trust. When people lie, they have broken a bond – an unspoken agreement to treat others as we would like to be treated. Serious lying often makes it impossible for us to trust another person again. Because the issue (问题) of trust is at risk, coming clean about the lie as soon as possible is the best way to mend fences. If the truth only comes out once it is forced, repair of trust is far less likely. As a parent, the most important message you can send to your children about lying is that you always – always – want them to come clean with you. No matter how small a lie they have told, remind them that you would always rather hear the truth, no matter how bad it is, than be cheated. Tell them there is really nothing better in your relationship than your trust of each other.

        Ecotourism is a form of tourism based on the concept of sustainable development and the premise of protecting the ecological environment. With the principle of harmonious development between human beings and nature, it takes advantage of favorable natural ecological environment and distinctive human ecosystem, and adopts an eco-friendly approach to have people derive physical and mental pleasure from their ecological experience, education and cognition. China’s ecotourism is developed on the basis of nature reserves, forest parks and scenic spots, and has now presented a diversity of forms including excursion, exploration, fishing and fruit picking in the countryside.
